Here are all the spoilers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Like many shows during the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic, the production of <a href=#>American Idol </a>has been affected by social distancing mandates. Show runners decided to get creative, and the first-ever American Idol from home episode aired on Sunday, April 26 — during which the top 20 contestants performed from their living rooms and backyards.</p><p>The upcoming May 3 episode, which will also be filmed at home, will reveal the top 10 contestants.</p><p>However, there's a potential catch: Judges Lionel Richie, Luke Bryan, and Katy Perry are expected to use their one (and only) save. This would technically make it the top 11, according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Idol Pad</a>, which also offered spoilers about who these contestants will be. Without further ado, let's take a closer look at the American Idol top 10/11.</p><p><strong>Warning: Spoilers ahead! If you don't want the American Idol top 10 to be spoiled, then stop reading — like ASAP.</strong></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Arthur Gunn</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p><a href=#>Dibesh Pokharel — aka, Arthur Gunn</a> — is originally from Kathmandu, Nepal. He had been living in Wichita, Kans. for five years before auditioning for American Idol. These days, the 22-year-old a fan favorite. So it comes as little surprise that he (reportedly) made it to the top 10.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dillon James</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p><a href=#>Dillon James</a> is 26 and hails from Bakersfield, Calif.

With a scream-inducing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rendition of Harry Styles' song, "Falling,"</a> Francisco earned his spot in the top 20. And evidently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his cover of "American Dream"</a> by Katy Perry was enough to put him through to the top 10!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Grace Leer</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Grace Leer is 28 and from Nashville, Tenn. Evidently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her at-home performance of Faith Hill's "Cry"</a> was enough to prompt Americans to vote her into the top 10.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jonny West</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Johnny West can also count himself among this season's top 10 on American Idol. The 23-year-old piano teacher from Murrieta, Calif., got emotional <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">while singing, "What a Wonderful World" </a>on the Feb. 26 at-home episode.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jovin Webb</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Jovin Webb clearly blew viewers away with his rendition of, "With a Little Help from My Friends." Which is why the 29-year-old from Gonzales, La., appears to have safely made it to the American Idol top 10.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Julia Gargano</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Julia Gargano is still in the running, too. The 22-year-old college student from Staten Island sang a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">passionate version of "Human"</a> from the safety of her home.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Louis Knight</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Louis Knight performed, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"If The World Was Ending,"</a> at home, which earned him a spot in American Idol's top 10. The 19-year-old pizza delivery guy hails from Philadelphia, Pa.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Makayla Phillips</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>It looks like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Makayla Phillips' performance of "Greedy"</a> by Ariana Grande was enough to land her a spot in the top 10. Will the 17-year-old from Temecula, Calif., make it all the way?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Samantha Diaz (A.K.A. Just Sam)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam sang "I Believe" </a>from the comfort (and safety) of her home — and viewers clearly loved it. That's because the 21-year-old from Harlem, Ny., was voted on to the top 10 in this season of American Idol.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sophia James (Wackerman)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Which brings us to Sophia James. The 20-year-old college student from Long Beach, Calif., <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;sang, "Burning</a>." And she was on fire. If the judges opt to use their save to make it a top 11, then The Idol Pad predicts Sophia will be the lucky one to move on.</p><p>Again, it's worth pointing out that none of these spoilers have been officially confirmed yet — and they won't until Sunday, May 3.</p><p>Be sure to tune into American Idol at 8 p.m. (ET) Sundays on ABC to see, for sure, who America voted into the top 10 — as well as whether judges really did use their save to make it a top 11 instead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrqmvsicmKdlmZm8rXnTqKdmaWBiwLG7yKWcq6s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
