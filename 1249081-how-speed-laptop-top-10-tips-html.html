Reduce startup programs</h3><p class=align-left>Many computer programs are designed in a way that allows them to auto-start each time the laptop is turned on. They are designed this way to allow quick startup when the user turns on the laptop. When a machine has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">too many programs</a> on auto-start, they may slow it down. Some of these programs, for example, antiviruses, are essential, and it is better to leave the program unchanged. Others such as games slow down the computer and are not always required.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/648255ae10537131.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting Google hacks: Top things to do on Google</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b6d360abb7389f1c.jpg><p class=align-left>To resolve unnecessary slowing down, you can decide the programs you want to run at startup.

Uninstall the programs you do not use</h3><p class=align-left>Another simple technique on how to speed up computer is deleting the applications that you no longer need. It is common for users to have a build-up of programs, some of which are no longer required. Some of these include disc cleaners, games, virus scanners, large movie files, and backup tools, all of which run in the background. Usually, these unnecessary applications clutter and waste the system resources.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/648255ae10537131.jpeg><p class=align-left>How to make laptop faster Windows 10?

The latest editions of Windows may not require this because they auto-defragment the drive. In the older computer models, there is an essential Microsoft tool that you can use for this task. There are also other defragmenting tools such as IObit's Smart Defrag 5 and O&O Defrag that may be better. Conduct your research before selecting one.</p><p class=align-left><strong>NB:</strong> Defragmenters should only be used on PCs that have a traditional mechanical hard drive, and NEVER in machines that have SSD.</p><p class=align-left>What is defragmentation? Defragmentation is the process that helps in reorganising data so that the machine can run faster. To defragment your hard drive, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Go to the <strong>Start</strong> button and type <strong>Defrag</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Defragment</strong> followed by <strong>Optimise Drives</strong>.</li><li>Choose a drive and click <strong>Analyze disk</strong>.

Scan for spyware and viruses</h3><p class=align-left>Laptops that are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">infected with spyware</a> or viruses are normally very slow. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Spyware refers to</a> any applications or programs that are installed in the PC without the user's knowledge. They are used to monitor the user's internet activities. The signs of a computer that is infected with a virus include slowing down, unexpected messages that randomly pop up on the screen, and programs that start automatically.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b1be0fdbd481de5a.jpg><p class=align-left>You can resolve the spyware problem using Windows Defender or any other antispyware program. To deal with viruses, it is essential to ensure that they do not affect your computer by frequently running updated antivirus software.</p><h3>5. Turn off animations and visual effects</h3><p class=align-left>If you want to know how to speed up my laptop, you should try <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">turning off any animations</a> and visual effects on your PC. Animations and effects, especially in Windows 10, are used to make the computer more stylish. They can be easily turned off to allow the computer to run faster. To turn off these elements, follow these easy steps:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7injpl3n5tb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to ☉ track a stolen phone in Nigeria?</span></p></a><ul><li>Press the <strong>Windows Key</strong> and <strong>X/</strong> right-click at the <strong>start button</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>System</strong> then click <strong>Advanced System Settings</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Performance</strong>, click the <strong>Settings option</strong>.</li><li>Under the <strong>Visual Effects</strong>, choose <strong>Adjust for best performance</strong>. You can also select <strong>Custom</strong> to manually select the specific animations you no longer wish to have. The visual effects will be disabled.</li></ul><p class=align-left>If you are using Windows 7, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Click the <strong>Start</strong> button and go to <strong>Control Panel.</strong></li><li>In the search box, type <strong>Performance Information and Tools</strong> and click on it.</li><li>Go to <strong>Adjust Visual Effects</strong> then the <strong>Visual Effects</strong> tab.</li><li>Click <strong>Adjust for best performance</strong> then <strong>OK</strong>. Alternatively, you can choose <strong>Let Windows choose what's best for my computer</strong>.</li></ul><h3>6. Clean up the laptop's disk</h3><p class=align-left>Have you been asking yourself what simple processes exist regarding how to make laptop faster? One of them is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cleaning the disk</a> using the disc clean up feature. Disc Cleanup is a Windows feature that evaluates and removes programs and files that are unnecessary in your PC.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/41f89026d4544078.png><p class=align-left>To remove the unwanted junk, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Press the <strong>Windows logo</strong> and <strong>R</strong> keys simultaneously to bring the <strong>Run box</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>cleanmgr</strong> or <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Check each of the boxes adjacent to the files that you wish to clean up then click <strong>Clean up system files</strong>.</li><li>Wait for a few minutes for the machine to calculate, then click <strong>OK</strong> and <strong>Delete Files</strong> to allow the clean-up.</li><li>When the computer completes the clean-up, restart it.</li></ul><h3>7. Update all the drivers</h3><p class=align-left>Outdated or faulty drivers and programs tend to make PCs to slow down. By <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">updating the drivers</a>, you will fix bugs and enhance the computer's performance. Although Windows updates are automatic in the newer versions, it is essential to check for these updates. What is a driver anyway? A driver is a program that enables Windows to access hardware such as scanners, sound devices and webcams. They enable the hardware to communicate with the software.</p><p class=align-left>Drivers can either be updated manually or automatically. To do it automatically, you can use applications such as Driver Easy. To use Driver Easy, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Download <strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Driver Easy </a></strong>and install it.</li><li>Run the application, then click <strong>Start Now</strong>. It will scan the computer and detect any problems with the drivers.</li><li>Next, click the<i> </i><strong>Update</strong> button to download and install the required driver(s) automatically.</li><li>Restart the computer and check if the speed has improved.</li></ul><p class=align-left>The manual method of fixing drivers is for people with advanced computer skills. It requires you to search the correct driver that matches with your Windows operating system on the manufacturer's website and to install them. The process is also time-intensive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c1bff1fb82492398.jpg><h3>8. Increase the laptop's memory/ add more RAM</h3><p class=align-left>RAM is the acronym for random access memory. It is a type of memory storage that enables laptops to hold large files and feature games. By increasing the RAM, the speed of a computer that contains many large files is enhanced. It is important to note that not all laptops have upgradable RAM.</p><h3>9. Install SSD</h3><p class=align-left>SSD means <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">solid-state drive</a>. It stores data in memory chips, unlike the traditional hard drives. SSDs need installation, so if you are not familiar with them, you may have to ask someone who is more experienced for installation services. Since there are no moveable parts when using SSDs, they are superior to traditional optical hard drives. They are faster.</p><h3>10. Reinstall Windows/ Reset the PC</h3><p class=align-left>If all the above tips fail to fix your problem, you should go for a fresh Windows installation. In Windows 10, 8 and 8.1, this is very easy because all you have to do is to use the inbuilt Reset your PC feature. When you do this, all your programs will be deleted, but all the files will remain intact. Reinstallation removes unwanted software, removes malware and cleans out all the junk files.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8af2d5fd3c758519.jpg><p class=align-left>In Windows 8, follow these steps to reset your laptop:</p><ul><li>Bring up the <strong>Charms bar</strong> on the right side then click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Change PC settings</strong> then click <strong>Update</strong> and <strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Refresh your PC without affecting your files</strong> then <strong>Get started</strong>.</li></ul><p class=align-left>In Windows 10, use these easy steps:</p><ul><li>Click the <strong>Start button</strong> then go to the <strong>Settings App</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Update & security</strong> then select <strong>Recovery</strong> from the menu that comes on the left.</li><li>On the right, click the <strong>Reset this PC</strong> option.</li></ul><p class=align-left>For older computer models, a Windows disc will be required for the reinstallation process. Before completely reinstalling Windows, make sure you copy and save your files in a different drive as this will erase everything.</p><p class=align-left>All laptops become slower with extended use. Yours is no exception. When this happens, you can enhance their performance first before discarding them. Learning how to speed up laptop is relatively easy with the above tips. Try them out today and enjoy having your computer in its proper working condition.</p><p></p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong></p><ul><li>How to check word count on Google Docs</li><li>How to insert signature in Word</li></ul><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnOAmGlvamWYpMRuv8%2BenJ1lnJa9tbvPZquoqF1mfW7AyKmqZ6Ckork%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
