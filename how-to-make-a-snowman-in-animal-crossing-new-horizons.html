Sometimes, that can be a bit of a hassle (like when you forget to check your morning turnip prices until 11:59 a.m. and then find out you could have sold them for a huge profit, or when you‚Äôre waiting for Tom Nook to finally finish building a bridge). But most of the time, it‚Äôs nice to have something to look forward to both in the real world and in a game that takes place in real-world time.</p><p>For players in the northern hemisphere, it‚Äôs currently shark season. But if you‚Äôre in the southern hemisphere (or your game is, anyway), it‚Äôs winter! And in Animal Crossing, winter means it‚Äôs time to make snowmen on your island. Whether you‚Äôre in the southern hemisphere and experiencing the in-game dead of winter, or you‚Äôre a northern hemisphere player who just wants to be prepared, here‚Äôs <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>how to make a snowman in </u><u>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</u><u>.</u></a></p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Nintendo via Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here‚Äôs how to make your perfect snowman in ‚ÄòAnimal Crossing: New Horizons‚Äô.</h2><p>The first thing you need to make a snowman in Animal Crossing: New Horizons is (obviously) snow. That should appear naturally on your island in the winter season. After that, you should go searching around your island and look for snowballs. They spawn randomly in your island‚Äôs snowy areas just like fossils.</p><p>Once you find the snowballs, simply walk up to them. Your character will start kicking them around in the snow. As they roll around, they‚Äôll start to get bigger ‚Äî&nbsp;just like snowballs in real life. You‚Äôll want to roll two snowballs around until you have one snowball that‚Äôs as large as possible (you‚Äôll be able to tell when you reach max size because your character will slow down when pushing it) and one slightly smaller one. This next part is the most important.</p><p>Get the two snowballs close to one another ‚Äî&nbsp;but you want to make sure to do this by pushing the smaller snowball. Once you get close enough, the snowball you‚Äôre pushing will hop onto the other snowball, and a snowman‚Äôs face will appear. If you‚Äôve done it right, your snowman will greet you and say you did a great job. If you‚Äôve done it wrong, your snowman will still greet you, but he‚Äôll probably say something snarky about how you messed up his body proportions. Whoops!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Nintendo via Reddit</span></figure><p>The best part of snowmen in Animal Crossing: New Horizons is that they‚Äôre not just for decoration. When you make a perfect snowman, he‚Äôll give you a winter-themed DIY recipe! He‚Äôll also give you a Large Snowflake, which you‚Äôll need to craft the snowy DIYs. Remember, this is just for perfect snowmen ‚Äî&nbsp;that‚Äôs why you have to pay super close attention to the size of your snowballs. (BTW, if you accidentally make your head snowball too large, roll it around the plaza to knock some extra snow off!)</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>it's legit my dream to build a snow man and i've only achieved it thru this game :D <a href=#>#AnimalCrossing</a> <a href=#>#ACNH</a> <a href=#>#NintendoSwitch</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/lWYj5CnkPI</a></p>‚Äî ‚ì¢‚ìê‚ìö‚ì§‚ì°‚ìê‚Å∑ üå∏ (@moniqueen93) <a href=#>June 12, 2020</a></figure><p>Alas, as with real-life snowmen, your Animal Crossing snowman will eventually melt and disappear. He‚Äôll last for three days total (and will give you a Large Snowflake each one of those three days). There are 15 snow-themed DIYs to collect in total, so be on the lookout for snowballs throughout the winter if you want to get them all. Have fun (and stay warm)!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKaZm5p6onnSp6awpZGjeqq6jJqloqWRoXqkvs6sqqKml2K7psOMoaaroaqku7Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
