Related parties include: Entities over which the company exercises significant influence.”</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and NGX listing rules had stated that dealing by an insider should be reported to the capital market regulator and authority in 48hours after a trade.</p><p>The firm, however, disclosed that its transaction 54 days after the investing public is not known if the SEC and NGX received the report during the required due date, <strong>Naija News</strong> reports.</p><p>According to the capital market authorities, free float is the volume of a company’s share available for the public to purchase, and the listing rules says that quoted firms are required to have 20%.</p><p>However, BUA Foods’ free float is 0.17% according to Business Day, which means the control of the company is concentrated at Abdulsamad, giving him substantial influence over the direction of the firm.</p><p>The development means buying and selling of shares in a company with free float below 20% is largely done by a small group of investors holding significant influence, and it reflects high volatility for investment, while companies with 20% or above equate low volatility and are more preferred by institutional investors.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that BUA Foods has until January 4, 2023, to comply with the free float requirement, making its latest insider dealing shocking, considering it’s supposed to be freeing up shares, not mopping it up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e49qZputkWK8uLrEq2SrmZKewm6twZ2spauRoq6lecCcqK6hoprAboGPaaRmq6SksKx5wKagnWWjobalsYyipWaml616p77EnmSfpJ%2BWwXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
