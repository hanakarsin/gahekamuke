If this had happened, maybe, on a Monday, they would have shifted it to other people.</p><p>“We have had instances where criminals under the watch of the state government will go and cause havoc and they will turn around to blame IPOB.</p><p>“I want to use this opportunity to make it clear that we must distinguish and differentiate criminals from genuine IPOB members who are agitating for one thing or the other.</p><p>“We cannot be fooled anymore by criminals taking undue advantage of the situation in the South-East to cause havoc. We request the security agencies to please come to our aid.</p><p>“The people in charge of APGA in this state have also boasted that they are in charge of the security apparatus in the state. They have boasted that they could do anything they like, just as a federal lawmaker boasted that no party, especially the APC, should be allowed to campaign in Anambra.</p><p>“My question now is: what are our security agencies doing? Are they waiting until all of us are killed before they start investigations on these issues? I hope and pray that the good Lord will grant the soul of Chief Alex Edozieuno a peaceful rest.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5BtZpqol5Z6s7HSqaanq5mXuaZ5xaipZqWlp7GmvoyonWasn6V6orrAppmrmV2ivK%2Bt0ZyfZpmgmHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
