It also doesn't hurt that he's pretty adorable. The contestant's name is James Holzhauer, and Monday marks his eighth consecutive win on the show. Today's <a href=#>Jeopardy! winnings </a>helped Holzhauer rack up a total of $460,479. In 2004, Ken Jennings ended up with $2,520,700 after winning 74 games in a row, and before Holzhauer, there was Dave Madden, who won $430,400 after 19 games in 2005. Still, Holzhauer is in awesome company ‚Äî and it's not too late to beat Jennings' high score.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In fact, Holzhauer already broke a Jeopardy! record last Tuesday</h2><p>The contestant won $110,914 in a single day ‚Äî the most anyone has ever won in such a short time span on the show.

The math whiz has a wife and 4-year-old daughter (who he adorably called "Booger" in last week's game, after he won $110, 914 in her honor). Watch below:</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Jame's wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Melissa Sassin Holzhauer</a>, is also a talented game show contestant. In 2012, she was on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and won $28,800. James is very close to his family in general, and often gives them shout-outs on TV. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He told The Chicago Tribune</a>, "As for the shout-outs, family will be more important to me than money or winning on Jeopardy!, and the bets were a fun and unconventional way for me to show them that."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Jeopardy! isn't the only game show James has been on. In 2014, he competed in The Chase, which is similar to Jeopardy! in that you just have to know a lot of random stuff. In The Chase, three contestants earn money by answering questions as quickly as they can, and they each have 60-second rounds. You can watch the episode below:</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What's next for James Holzhauer?</h2><p>James is back on Jeopardy! tomorrow (April 16) to compete with two new contestants. This will be his ninth episode. And if you're just as obsessed with James as the rest of the country, you can always visit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his fan-page account</a>.
