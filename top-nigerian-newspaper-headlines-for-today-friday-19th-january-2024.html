urged security agencies to step up efforts to apprehend everyone involved in the incident.</p><p>During a recent plenary session, the House addressed the matter following a motion titled “URGENT NEED FOR ALL REGULATORY AGENCIES TO ENFORCE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS ESPECIALLY IN HANDLING AND STORING OF EXPLOSIVES (DYNAMITES) IN VIEW OF THE EXPLOSION THAT ROCKED OLD BODIJA AREA OF IBADAN ON TUESDAY, 16TH JANUARY, 2024,” presented by Adebayo Babajide, representing Ibadan North II.</p><p>The Majority Leader, Sanjo Adedoyin, revealed that the explosion originated from a property in the Dejo Oyelese area of Bodija, reportedly owned by Yusuf.</p><p>The Assembly expressed deep concern over how such explosives were brought and stored in a residential area, demanding clarity on who authorized the storage

Regulatory Commission (NERC), Sanusi Garba, on Wednesday who said the new rates are effective from January 1, 2024.</p><p>He, however, added that the government has decided to continue to subsidize electricity this year, hence consumers may not feel the impact of the upward review in tariff because the government would be paying the differential.</p><p>Asked for how long the government will pay the subsidy, Garba said: “Any time the government takes a decision on subsidy, we will take it into consideration in our next tariff.</p><p>“In other words, even if there is an upward review of the cost of electricity, the government will be absorbing the increase for as long as it can.”</p><p>The Federal Government of Nigeria has amended the charges against the former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, from six to twenty.</p><p>The amended charges were made public on Thursday, January 18, 2024, during a court appearance before Justice Hamza Muazu of the FCT

trial on Thursday, the counsel of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Rotimi Oyedepo, said he had served the defence team with an amended charge.</p><p>Responding, Mathew Burkaa, Emefiele’s counsel, said he would need some time to study the new charge before his client could enter a plea.</p><p>The presiding judge thereafter adjourned the case to Friday, January 19.</p><h2>That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
