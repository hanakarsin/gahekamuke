Spots that use all sorts of artificial syrups and pre-mixed concoctions, but tons of booze so that you're feeling a little light-headed after one drink, and if you down that second you already bought a one-way ticket to drunksville.</p><p>Apparently, Chili's is one such location, believe it or not. If you're an Office fan then you've probably believed this is a joke but then began taking it as a sign of your undying devotion to the series.</p><p>But now there's what many people are calling definitive proof of how strong the purveyors of baby back ribs make their cocktails.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok | @dappertafterdark</span></figure><p>TikToker <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@dapperafterdark</a> uploaded a clip with a caption that reads: "This is why your girl gets drunk at Chili's."
