Unlike Season 19, the Season 20 taping schedule for the NBC competition reality show is starting relatively on time. Once again, due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, producers are seating a 'virtual' audience which allows fans to watch from home via digital technology,” the outlet reported.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The show operates on two types of episodes — pre-recorded and live. The blind auditions, battle, and knockout rounds are all pre-recorded (typically while the previous season is airing).

Contestants and audience members are not allowed to carry cell phones to the recordings in hopes that no spoilers will leak.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The contestants are not allowed to post about their selections or eliminations on social media until the episode has aired to prevent spoilers or to not ruin the shock element of certain eliminations made by the celebrity judges. Filming of the series primarily takes place on a set in Universal Studios, Universal City, Calif.</p><p>While the iconic set is still in Universal City, Season 20 has been formatted differently because there will be no live audience. “The decision was taken to maintain the filming guidelines that are in effect due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The coach chairs were also placed at a distance to follow social distancing guidelines. The show’s fans can still take part in the filming of the season by buying tickets to be a part of the virtual audience,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cinemaholic</a> reported.</p><p>If you want to be a member of the virtual audience, you may want to keep an eye on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1iota</a> for tickets.
