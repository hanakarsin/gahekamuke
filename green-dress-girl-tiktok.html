The 34-year-old influencer then asked if she needed to "come out of retirement" and teach the young ladies how it's done. Rae shared that she had just left the club and "the amount of flats and sandals I saw" brought her nothing but disgust.</p><p>In her 1-minute TikTok rant, she said she reminded her viewers how dancing on the club's couch in your heels makes the night so much better and the flats girlies are missing out.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@raechristine___ href=#>@raechristine___</a><p>Donâ€™t get me wrong I believe in being comfortable but I donâ€™t think the club is the place for that ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚ <a title=lasvegas href=#>#lasvegas</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=nightlife href=#>#nightlife</a> <a title=clubbing href=#>#clubbing</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - Rae Christine" href=#>â™¬ original sound - Rae Christine</a></figure><p>Rae's TikTok quickly circulated and resulted in many not-so-nice comments. Many users dragged her for wearing what they deemed a "basic" look as she rocked a green strapless dress and a white block heel. The heels were mocked relentlessly, with some calling them "Bingo heels," "Easter heels," and other aunty references.</p><p>Despite the insults, Rae seemingly doesn't mind the extra attention to her TikTok account. In addition to creating content, the Chicago-based influencer is a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">personal brand coach</a> who calls herself "Olivia Pope IRL."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@raechristine___ href=#>@raechristine___</a><p>Iâ€™m still trying to wrap my mind around it all, but I do want to thank people who have sent supportive messages! <a title=girlinthegreendress href=#>#girlinthegreendress</a> <a title=greendress href=#>#greendress</a> <a title=greendressgirl href=#>#greendressgirl</a> <a title=girlinthegreendress href=#>#girlinthegreendress</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - Rae Christine" href=#>â™¬ original sound - Rae Christine</a></figure><p>Rae uses her platform to show how she would "spin" a controversial moment. Following her own viral moment, Rae analyzed the situation in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">follow-up video</a>. She shared in the post that she had "no idea" her video would circulate the way it did. She also said the video was taken out of context.</p><p>"I don't have much to say about the video itself besides that I was joking," Rae said. "I was genuinely joking. I have dry humor."</p><p>There you have it!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnL%2Bmsc1mm6udo6h6qLXRpWStoZupvKw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
