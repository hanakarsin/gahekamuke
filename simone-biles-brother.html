Cleveland police identified him as the shooter of a 2018 New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb.</p><p>A fight broke out at the Airbnb when a group of uninvited guests arrived. The altercation led to the deaths of three men during the dispute: Delvante Johnson, 19; Toshaun Banks, 21; and Devaughn Gibson, 23.</p><p>On May 25, 2021, a judge in Ohio initially declared a mistrial after jurors said that "they had read legal paperwork that inadvertently was included in evidence given to them to review," according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC Boston</a>. The 12 jurors recognized the error on the third day of deliberations, noting that they had received copies of legal briefs arguing over whether Tevin Biles-Thomas acted in self-defense.</p><p>Tevin's retrial took place on Tuesday, June 15, 2021. Tevin maintained his innocence in the two years following the event, pleading not guilty to the charges against him. Joseph Patituce, one of Tevin’s defense attorneys, also noted that in addition to the stress of maintaining his innocence, Tevin also lost his cousin to the violence.</p><p>"I mean, it can't be forgotten that Tevin not only has suffered through two and a half years of defending himself, but he also lost a loved one, too," Joseph said per&nbsp;NBC. On June 15, 2021, Judge Joan Synenberg "granted a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal by the defense for lack of evidence,"&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN&nbsp;reports</a>. Tevin's charges of voluntary manslaughter and felony assault charges have been dropped.</p><p>In 2019, Simone also gave a statement <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Twitter</a>, writing, "My heart aches for everyone involved, especially for the victims and their families. There is nothing I can say that will heal anyone's pain, but I do want to express my sincere condolences to everyone affected by this terrible tragedy. I ask everyone to please respect my family's privacy as we deal with our pain."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>still having a hard time processing last weeks news <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/GU0nQt2PZY</a></p>— Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) <a href=#>September 3, 2019</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Thankfully, it appears that a grim situation finally has an ending, and after nearly two and a half years of trials, Simone and her family can be at peace.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLauu82eZJuhnJrAbq7RqKuhnaI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
