Alan — who is the host of the Peacock series — revealed to us that filming in his home country was a big factor in why he chose the job.</p><p>"I love working in Scotland," he said. "And it was kind of glamorous, actually, because I had a room...I didn't actually stay in the castle. But I had a room when I got ready and my clothes and it was vast. And with a gigantic bed, which I laid in a lot at the time."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Alan was grateful to the production crew, explaining, "They just feed you and look after you and I actually really enjoyed it. And it was like being in a sort of what do you call it, an immersive piece of theater. I would walk out of my room and I'd be in on the set enough to sort of become the character."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>For other contestants, competing on a show while living in a grandiose castle was certainly not a bad day job.</p><p>"Everything was so green and lush and gorgeous.

It was really beautiful there. The castle is incredible. Staying there was really interesting.
