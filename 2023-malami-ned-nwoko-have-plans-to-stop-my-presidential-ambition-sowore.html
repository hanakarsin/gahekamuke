We are more than ready! #RevolutionNow #WeCantContinueLikeThis.”</p><p>“Earlier yesterday morning a group of well-armed govt sponsored miscreants attacked our contingent, assaulted and stole their phones in the Gudu area of Abuja on our way to the Court of Appeal.</p><p>“The case was immediately reported to the police but they did nothing about it. It turns out it was part of a bigger plot as later in the afternoon a group of well-armed policemen accosted me outside the Court of Appeals gate in Abuja arrested me, accusing me of “defamation” over reports published by SaharaReporters, a standalone legal entity.</p><p>“After hours of detention, they let me leave. I have just been informed now that they’ve procured a judge to remand me in prison custody because they heard I am planning to declare my Presidential ambition early next week. I will be bearding out shortly to meet them, I am fully prepared and very convinced that they are irreversibly heading towards self-destruction. #RevolutionNow #WeCantContinueLikeThis.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5FuZmtoYmh6rq3LmqSiZZ6asW661qiiqGWYlsOmec%2BlmKerXam8br%2FTqKdmpalivbOx0qKbnqaknq6tecCmmaKsmaS7br%2FOsKarnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
