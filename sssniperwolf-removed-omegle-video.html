In his video published on Oct. 16, Alex highlights SSSniperwolf’s interaction with the minors, where she types out she’ll “show tits” in exchange for them to “twerk for [her].”</p><p>His video blurs out the minors for their safety, but they are twerking and doing whatever else she wants.</p><p>“To really understand the gravity: She even acted as the director of that video, telling those children what they should do on cam,” said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one Redditor</a>.</p><p>Another Reddit user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> there are “other Omegle videos where she is being creepy with minors” but didn’t expand more on what actually happened in those clips, except stating they were “incriminating videos.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">SSSniperwolf’s grooming allegations have been a thing for years, but YouTube has never taken action against her.</h2><p>This week uncovered a lot of skeletons in SSSniperwolf’s closet, but what’s very interesting is how YouTube never took action against her for the videos with minors.</p><p>“A lot of people reported it over the past two days to no avail,” stated a Redditor. “I guess this proves she is officially exempt from the [Terms of Service], including the child abuse rules.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One user</a> is hopeful SSSniperwolf at least “loses her partnership with YouTube” if they don’t deplatform her since she has become a “legal liability,” but nothing suggests YouTube is doing so.</p><p>SSSniperwolf is aware of the increasing visibility of her channel and videos, so removing clips and changing the narrative in her favor may just prevent issues for her. Regardless, we'll have to wait to find out what happens next.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMC0usipnKuvn6Gzbr7EpqavnZRivK6xxqWcZq6ZmbKw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
