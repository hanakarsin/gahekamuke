She got thrown into the midst of a dumpster fire of feuds, and their husbands came right along with them. Rachel had a target on her back immediately, thanks to her friendship with <a href=#>Melissa Gorga</a>. And this led to some crazy developments that got <a href=#>John Fuda</a> involved. Now, Rachel and John are back, and John is slimmer and getting candid about his 50-pound weight loss.</p><p>Rachel and John are both married and in business together. John started a company called Valet King, which is growing fast, according to <a href=#>Bravo</a>'s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Dish</a>. John's family also has a business called Fuda Tiles. Rachel's friendship with Melissa made her an immediate enemy of <a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a> and her newly minted husband, <a href=#>Luis Ruelas</a>. This feud continued into Season 14, and John's weight loss made him fit and ready to protect his wife.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">'RHONJ's' John Fuda gets candid about his weight loss.</h2><p>Season 14's premiere showcased a slimmer John Fuda from the previous one. John recently announced that he lost 50 pounds and shared the details of his weight loss with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People magazine</a>. That process included a mix of treatments, surgical procedures, diet, and exercise. John said of his decision, "As a man, a lot of times, you forget yourself ... You're providing for your family constantly, that you often put yourself last."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What did John Fuda do to lose 50 pounds?</h2><p>John's candor about his weight loss is commendable, as he shared every step of his process, not skipping any details out of fear of judgment. He got liposuction prior to the <a href=#>Season 13</a> reunion but wanted to feel healthier. Then he started working with a wellness program under the care of a certified physician's assistant, which involved using "injectable peptides and hormones tailor-made to fit [his] needs." He shared that the liposuction was more like a "kick start" to his weight loss process.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Where do things stand with John Fuda and Luis Ruelas?</h2><p>Rachel and John addressed a photo that she posted of the cast with Teresa Giudice obviously cropped out on <a href=#>Teddi Mellencamp</a>'s podcast, Two T's in a Pod. When asked about why she did it, John hopped in with his own response, stating, "I think once you see the season, it'll make sense why she would cut her out." He added later, "Fudas are honest. We say it how it is. If we don't have a relationship, there's no point in faking it."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">John and Luis came to blows during the Season 13 reunion.</h2><p>Luis took it upon himself to bring a private investigator to look into John and Rachel, as well as the rest of the cast. He bragged about it initially, only to turn around at <a href=#>the reunion</a> and deny ever doing the deed. John, however, did his research and was armed with receipts. Rachel also shared that <a href=#>Bo Dietl</a>, the private investigator in question, also happened to be seated right next to her while she was having dinner with Melissa Gorga, adding, "What are the odds of that happening?"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7ypuoyfrJ2ZXayyqrPHrWSlp6OoerO0zqeh</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
