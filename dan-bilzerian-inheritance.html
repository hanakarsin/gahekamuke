It's almost as if he wanted to become a living party legend and is portraying that on Instagram.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Going through old pics, this book gonna be crazy</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Dan Bilzerian</a> (@danbilzerian) on Apr 19, 2020 at 12:54am PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">But Dan Bilzerian had a sizable inheritance.</h2><p>You ever watch the movie Magnolia where Tom Cruise plays one of these Alpha Male type dudes who espouses and disseminates a misogynistic doctrine on making all of your female counterparts a sexual slave to your whims and desires?

His father, Paul Bilzerian, was wrapped up in a white-collar crime scheme, and left a ton of trusts carefully constructed and disseminated so the government couldn't touch them.</p><p>Dan claims to have won over 50 million dollars playing poker, but in a Wall Street Journal interview, he admitted to receiving some money from his father's fortune, but declined to say just how much.</p><p>While how Dan made his money is suspect, the way his father did in the '80s, was not. He was basically another unsavory movie character, Gordon Gekko: Paul was a "corporate raider."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Battles</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Dan Bilzerian</a> (@danbilzerian) on Mar 17, 2020 at 1:51am PDT</p></figure><p>Double speaking when it comes to finances seems to be a trait that Dan inherited from his father: the man declared bankruptcy at one point and then went to prison for lying about his finances.</p><p>A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Florida judge in 2001 said</a>, "Between 1994 and 1999, Bilzerian transferred his substantial assets into a complex ownership structure of off-shore trusts and family-owned companies and partnerships. It is clear that he did this purposefully to insulate his assets from the reach of his creditors."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vice did a phenomenal</a> write-up of the questions surrounding Dan Bilzerian's inheritance and trusts, along with all of the shady financial dealings his father was involved with.</p><p>So while Dan claims he was a "self-made man" there's a lot of evidence to prove that this simply isn't the case. However, there are plenty of rich kids who just piss away their Daddy's money without making more of it, and to Dan's credit, it does seem like he's either earning more cash, or keeping whatever financial schemes his father Paul established, greased and perpetually turning.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma6vecGio7Odop6ur3nIp5%2Beqpmprq%2BvxA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
