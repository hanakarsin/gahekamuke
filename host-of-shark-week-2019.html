Have the sharks gone Hollywood on us? Here's everything you need to know at this fin-tastic time of year!&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is the host of Shark Week 2019? Unofficially, it&amp;apos;s Rob Riggle.</h2><p>In previous years, Discovery has announced one official host for the entire duration of Shark Week festivities. In 2018, <a href=#>Shaquille O'Neal</a> had the honor, and Rob Riggle joined him on a shark expedition.&nbsp;</p><p>For Shark Week 2019, Rob is hosting <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shark After Dark</a>, a nightly roundup of Shark Week's most awesome moments. He'll be joined by celebrity guests and shark experts throughout the week.&nbsp;</p><p>Rob is also featured prominently in Shark Week 2019 promos. He's officially just hosting <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shark After Dark</a>, though, and not the entirety of Shark Week's programming.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Recognize Rob Riggle? He&amp;apos;s been in a ton of stuff.</h2><p>The comic actor was a <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> cast member from 2004 to 2005, and he worked as a correspondent on Comedy Central's <a href=#>The Daily Show</a> from 2006 to 2008. He's also had roles in The Hangover, Dumb & Dumber To, Step Brothers, and 21 Jump Street.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">He also spent more than 20 years in the United States Marines.&amp;#xA0;</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Military.com</a>, Rob served for nine years on active duty before going into the reserves. He became a public affairs officer and was usually attached to Command Elements. His initial military ambition was to be a <a href=#>pilot</a>, but he ultimately left flight school to pursue comedy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"I went through officer's candidate school, went through flight school and the further I got along, the more I realized if I continue flying I'm not gonna be able to pursue my dream of comedy and acting," he said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBSNews.com</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"So I stopped flying, became a ground officer, had a short contract, fulfilled my contract, and pursued comedy and acting. I stayed in the reserves though and did the reserves for the last 14 years... This is a great country, you can do it all."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why are some people upset about Rob Riggle bringing his celebrity pals to Shark Week?</h2><p>Everyone seems to agree that Rob himself brings a great dynamic to Discovery, but many people think sharks — not celebrities — should remain the stars of Shark Week 2019.</p><p>A viewer named Jen Hawkins <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>, "For the past couple of years, Shark Week has been less educational and more 'Look how many C-list celebrities we can get to act stupid around sharks.'"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Trust me they’re gonna love this...and so will you!
