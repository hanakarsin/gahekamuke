When one of these pairs break up, there's an inevitable trail left on social media that tells a dramatic tale of what exactly went wrong.</p><p>Back in the early spring of 2020, <a href=#>Dixie D'Amelio</a> and Griffin Johnson teased a potential romance to their respective fanbases.&nbsp;</p><p>The relationship was star-crossed by TikTok standards since Dixie was still in Hype House at the time, while Griffin was a member of the now-defunct <a href=#>Sway House</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite making videos together, things soured for the two amid infidelity accusations against Griffin. Though the two are now on separate paths (Dixie is dating Noah Beck, while Griffin is focused on YouTube shows and gaming), some fans will always be invested in what could have been.</p><p>Keep reading for the refresher on their break up.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Griffin and Dixie break up?</h2><p>All in all, Griffin and Dixie dated for less than five months before they parted ways. Though the romance would be a blip on regular people's radars, their rising fame levels have kept many invested.</p><p>In late July of 2020, eagle-eyed fans noticed that Dixie unfollowed her beau on both Instagram and TikTok. While this could have been chalked up to a glitch (albeit, a strange one), the Connecticut native soon began liking tweets about Griffin.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Friends that educate you on things you don‚Äôt know about >>>>>></p>‚Äî Mazi ‚ôï (@AjeboMarlian) <a href=#>July 29, 2020</a></figure><p>One read, "Friends that educate you on things you don't know about."</p><p>Griffin also hinted at a split by changing his Twitter header photo. Prior to the switch, the photo was one of him and Dixie. A TikTok user also posted a video exposing Griffin (he sent her flirty messages while he was dating Dixie, and this was after all the cheating allegations, which we'll get to in a second).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>- sent in</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>The Tiktok Shaderoom</a> (@tiktokroom) on Jul 30, 2020 at 1:07pm PDT</p></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>- sent in</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>The Tiktok Shaderoom</a> (@tiktokroom) on Jul 30, 2020 at 3:41pm PDT</p></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>yikes... dixie commentsüò¨üò¨‚òïÔ∏è</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>The Tiktok Shaderoom</a> (@tiktokroom) on Jul 30, 2020 at 4:08pm PDT</p></figure><p>And then there were the infidelity accusations.&nbsp;</p><p>After all, <a href=#>Griffin was accused of cheating on Dixie</a> back in early July of 2020 when the whole Chase Hudson drama went down. It was exposed that Chase cheated on Charli (Dixie's sister). Chase posted a statement on Twitter (which has since been deleted), which consisted of him accusing pretty much all the other well-known TikTokers of cheating on each other.&nbsp;</p><p>This included Griffin's alleged infidelity. Chase claimed that Griffin cheated on Dixie with Taylor Holder's ex Kaylyn, and Bryce Hall's ex, Elle.</p><p>The tweet wasn't up for long, but it wreaked havoc on many content creators.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>"I'm not going to let these hypocrites ruin my life without their lives being on the internet too," Chase wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Charli fired back by responding with, "Stop deflecting [your] actions onto others because you can‚Äôt take responsibility, Chase. Want me to talk about how you treated me throughout our relationship or do you just want to continue to play the victim?"&nbsp;</p><p>Griffin later did confirm that he Snapchatted other girls (like Chase alleged) but that these interactions took place before he was officially with Dixie.</p><p>After weeks of speculation, Griffin and Dixie confirmed where things stood between them.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span><p>Noah Beck and Dixie D'Amelio</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dixie confirmed her breakup with Griffin on her YouTube channel.</h2><p>Like many other influencer couples, the real drama went down on Dixie's YouTube channel. But, instead of offering fans dual breakup videos expressing each side, Dixie just mentioned her split in passing.</p><p>"Hey, so we actually broke up," Dixie said at the beginning of her "My Last Date" video in August of 2020. "But I had this video scheduled for today so I'm posting it anyways."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Griffin dropped a <a href=#>diss track</a> called "Convenient" about Dixie in September of 2020. He referred to his ex as "the one who didn't want" him, and he continued to deny the cheating allegations. He's also spoken out about how Dixie was close friends with Noah before they began officially dating.</p><p>Though this duo wasn't meant to be, they certainly gave fans plenty of content during their brief relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbalecaroJ%2BemaN6orrDZpuisJmaeqO%2BxJqiZq2g</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
