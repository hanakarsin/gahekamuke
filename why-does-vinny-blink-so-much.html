'Jersey Shore' fans have noticed the quirk —&nbsp;and there is actually a really good explanation.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Fans of the <a href=#>Jersey Shore</a> have noticed a small quirk about the self-proclaimed Keto Guido, <a href=#>Vinny Guadagnino</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"I hate this flinch that Vinny does when he's thinking about something he doesn't like. He like closes both eyes real tight for a second them opens them," one viewer commented on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>. Another agreed, comparing Vinny to Rob Kardashian, adding, "I noticed Rob Kardashian does the same weird tense blinking."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, why does Vinny blink so much?</h2><p>According to some fans, it all has to do with his struggles with anxiety, something Vinny has been very open about.&nbsp;"I have a lot of coping mechanisms," Vinny told Anderson Cooper of how he deals with his anxiety. "I never did medication... listening to music, meditating, working out —&nbsp;all that stuff."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p></figure><p>And his blinking is nothing new. "He’s had it for years," one fan wrote, defending the reality star. "You’ll notice it on all the previous Shore seasons if you go back and watch."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Vinny's anxiety forced him to quit filming the Jersey Shore in 2012.&nbsp;</h2><p>Back in Season 5, Vinny had to leave the Shore due to his chronic anxiety. "I have anxiety, like bad. My brain just doesn't work anymore dude. I can't sleep. I'm exhausted. I have nothing left in me," he explained at the time. "At this point, I'm starting not to think rationally. I'm burnt out and I'm pushing through but a car can only go so far on fumes."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MTV</span></figure><p>He opened even more about his history with anxiety, telling his boss Danny Merk, "I have clinical anxiety. I've had it since I was like 16 years old. It's either two ways: I get it and I kind of pull myself back at bay, by having little episodes. I just breathe — a real attack, totally disconnected. I've had them a million times in my life."&nbsp;</p><p>He continued, "Then what happens is, if I get in a different, stressful situation, I get so many that it puts me in a funk. More of a depressed state... I'm hoping now to develop some positive momentum, keep the wheels rolling, live in the moment, and not think of anything."&nbsp;</p><p>Vinny went on to write a book about his anxiety titled, Control the Crazy.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Now, Vinny is all about the Keto diet, which helps with his anxiety.&nbsp;</h2><p>Vinny has shared that his anxiety is triggered when he is not eating right or getting enough sleep. Since starting the program, Vinny has dropped 50 pounds.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>I’m not someone who can eat whatever i want and remain thin...With my genetics , if I look at a piece of bread I gain weight . So if I tell you that a way of eating causes real results, I mean it ...i have to work for anything i have... I’m also natural and have never taken any supplements or steroids.... _ Im not saying if you “go Keto” you’ll automatically get skinny and ripped. It still takes work( especially at first ) to navigate through this sugar and grain world ...it also takes hard work to fast, suffer in the gym and exercise , get good sleep, not party all the time , and live a balanced healthy life....but for me , #keto is the only way of eating which easily serves as a foundation for my healthy lifestyle to function. It’s sustainable and enjoyable. #ketoguido</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Vinny</a> (@ketoguido) on Jun 1, 2019 at 11:14am PDT</p></figure><p>"I was 50 pounds heavier and looked 10 years older," Vinny captioned a shirtless selfie. In another post, he encouraged his followers to give the diet a try, adding, "For me, taking it one meal at a time has always been a huge factor...your hungry brain could be very tempt[ed] to eat junk food, but your full and satiated brain thinks more rationally."&nbsp;</p><p>You can follow Vinny's journey on his dedicated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram page, @ketoguido.&nbsp;</a></p><p>We have a feeling Vinny still enjoys his mom's lasagna on cheat days!
