We are all witnessing the negative effects of insecurity in the land.</p><p>“These include incidents and cases of kidnapping, armed robberies, violence and other acts of insurrection.</p><p>“There is no way a police officer from Awka in Anambra can come to Oja Igbo in Ibadan and effectively police the area. He does not know the terrain. So, there is a need to decentralise the security architecture in the country.</p><p>“We must emphasize the fact that the social media has compounded the challenges of security and governance in the country. What do I mean?</p><p>“The new media has the advantage of quick and wide disemination of information, but the new media is also notorious for the spread of half-truths and fake news which can pose greater in the mind nation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5BqZqenXayuunnAZqeopJmYsm67xZ%2BgnJ2iYrOzu8xmmKeZnZe%2FonnCmqVmqJ%2BhtqSxjKKZmpyRo3qmssWemq2hppq5unnSnqWarJ%2BnerWx0qWgpmWWpLmivsinZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
