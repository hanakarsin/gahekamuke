After further investigation, the woman found out the bizarre reason why the patient was unable to pee — and yes, it involved an extremely misplaced <a href=#>potato</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A woman was having trouble urinating due to potato she put in her "lady garden."</h2><p>TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@nurse.connor</a> shared a video asking people in the medical industry what was the most off-guard thing a patient has ever asked them.</p><p>A woman named Melissa (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@rockmelissa</a>) stitched this video and shared a story about an elderly woman, estimated to be in her mid-90s, whom she was helping when she used to work in urology.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As Melissa explained, "While the question itself did not catch me off guard, the source of the problem did."</p><p>You see, the elderly woman had asked Melissa why she could not urinate, which is a pretty fair question.</p><p>“Her bladder was so full. It was so uncomfortable. I felt so bad for her," Melissa explained. To help remedy this problem, the patient was given a bladder scan, and it was decided that a Foley catheter would be used to drain her bladder.</p><p>But as Melissa tried to put the device into the woman's bladder, she discovered something unusual. "When I went to put in the Foley down in her 'lady garden,' she had an actual lady garden. There were leaves coming out of the area."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Melissa was beyond perplexed. She asked the patient why leaves were coming out of her "lady garden," and she responded, "Oh, I think I forgot to take out my potato."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As the patient explained, she had put a potato up there "to help keep my bladder from falling out."</p><p>The potato was being used as a makeshift pessary, which is "a removable device that is inserted into the vagina (birth canal) to provide support in the area of a prolapse," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cleveland Clinic</a>.</p><p>“She had forgotten about it, and it had sprouted. It had vines. And it had leaves. And that was why she couldn’t pee," Melissa explained. And for the potato experts out there, Melissa clarified that the potato "wasn't a Yukon gold or anything." It was just a white potato.</p><p>That said, once she removed the potato from the patient, the problem was solved, and she could pee again.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the comment section, users had a lot to say. "How are my plants dying?" asked one user, seemingly curious about how a literal potato sprouted inside a woman's private parts.</p><p>Other comments teased: "I'm glad you hashed that out," and, "This is a great DIY."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Moreover, one user claimed that she thought the dried-up leaves were because she was using leaves as toilet paper. Not because she had a potato growing in there.</p><p>But another user knew precisely why the woman had used a potato instead of getting an actual pessary: "The source of the problem being unaccessible healthcare."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>That couldn't be a more true statement. And now, patients are trying to treat themselves to save money and time instead of seeking professional medical help. Until this changes, this probably won't be the last we hear of potato lady gardens.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpby1rdOoZKKmXaWutbXEp6usZZyWsbp5xpqpnZ2e</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
