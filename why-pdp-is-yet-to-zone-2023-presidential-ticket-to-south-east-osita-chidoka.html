Do we struggle to win power first or continue our zoning as we have done or do we continue with the zoning even if that candidate may or may not win the election?</p><p>“First of all, the Igbo people will have to bring out a candidate that can convince Nigerians because Nigerians are not a party to this internal party zoning structures.”</p><p>Speaking further, he said should the ruling <strong><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">All Progressives Congress (APC)</a></strong> and the PDP field a south-easterner as their candidates, Nigerians would be left to vote the best candidate.</p><p>However, Chidoka disclosed that Nigerians have gotten to the stage whereby they will overlook their ethnic identities and consider the national interest first while voting for credible leaders.</p><h2>2023 Presidency: PDP Set To Follow “Mood Of The Country” In Choosing Candidate</h2><p>The <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)</a></strong> is reportedly set to avoid a potential banana skin situation by following the ‘mood of the country’ in deciding its candidate for the 2023 presidential election.</p><p>Amidst calls for the 2023 presidency to be zoned to the south and the attendant rejection by northern politicians interested in the position, the party is said to be on the lookout for how the ruling&nbsp;All Progressives Congress&nbsp;(APC) will choose its own candidate before committing to the next step.</p><p>A source who spoke on the matter said the move is to avoid any crisis and also at the same time present an acceptable candidate to Nigerians.</p><p>The source claims&nbsp;the PDP&nbsp;intends to wait until the APC candidate emerges, gauge the reaction of Nigerians before eventually deciding on either to zone its own ticket or throw it open.</p><p>The PDP also intends to use the strategy to neutralize whichever option the APC adopts even as both parties continue to evaluate aspirants against the controversial issue of zoning the 2023 presidency.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49yZrCgqWK9pbyMoqpmsZWperW7jLOmp51dZ31zf4ypqZ6rmZmyr8DImqNmrJmYuKbAjK2mZqufqsGpecSaqq1ln6i2ta2MnJ%2BinJ%2BgrnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
