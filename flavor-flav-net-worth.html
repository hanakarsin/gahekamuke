The lower side of that number seems right, and it seems likely that his net worth is somewhere between $5 and $10 million thanks to his career as a musician and the residuals he has received since. He has also partnered with a number of brands over the years to supplement that income.</p><p class="sc-ktvXtq dPyThM"><span>Flavor Flav</span></p><p class="sc-fxFQrc gpgOkp">Rapper</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $5 Million</p><p>Flavor Flav is an American rapper best known for founding the rap group Public Enemy alongside <a href=#>Chuck D</a>.

Flavor Flav came to support the team after one of the team's stars, Maggie Steffens, asked for support in May of 2024.</p><p>"[It] means everything to us and impacts our sport more than most," she wrote. "Many of my teammates aren’t just badass champions, but also teachers, business owners, coaches, physicians assistants, and more."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Maggie Steffens (@maggie.steffens)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram/@maggie.steffens</span></figure><p>"Some may not know this, but most Olympians need a second (or third) job to support chasing the dream (myself included!) and most teams rely on sponsors for travel, accommodations, nutritional support, rent/lodging, and simply affording to live in this day and age," she continued. "Especially female sports and female athletes. We’ve had companies and amazing individuals support our sport alongside donors, USAWP & USOPC, but we always need more help."</p><p>"As a <a href=#>girl dad</a> and supporter of all women's sports — imma personally sponsor you my girl. Whatever you need," Flavor Flav wrote after seeing Maggie's message. "Imma sponsor the whole team. My manager is in touch with your agent and imma use all my relationships and resources to help all y'all even more."</p><p>What's more, Flavor Flav held up his end of the bargain. He signed a five-year sponsorship deal with the team, and also made an undisclosed financial donation to them. It's no wonder he's become so beloved by them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7miws6rZJ%2Bkkat6r7HTZq6oqqSd</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
