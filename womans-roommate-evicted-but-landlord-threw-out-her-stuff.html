She unveils the traumatizing experience on TikTok in a three-part post detailing the events. Here's what happened to her in her words.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@ivynicholeee</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A woman's roommate was evicted, but her landlord threw out all her stuff instead.</h2><p>Ivy shared her take on the entire ordeal on TikTok. She explains that on Monday, May 8, 2023, she had come home to her apartment and found that her key didn't work on her door. After she called the front desk, they were able to get the door open. Unfortunately, Ivy came home to a completely empty apartment with all of her stuff having gone missing. Though she initially believed that she was robbed, she called up her former roommate to get in touch with the apartment general manager.</p><p>According to them, movers were assigned to clear out all of her roommate's things. Due to a mix-up with their room assignments, however, all of Ivy's stuff was removed instead. She reached out to apartment management, who essentially blamed her for the initial room mix-up instead of taking responsibility for her missing things.</p><p>Nevertheless, Ivy was asked to write up a list of her missing things for possible reimbursement. Her list reportedly totals over $19,000 worth of damages.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@ivynicholeee href=#>@ivynicholeee</a><p>This is probably one of the hardest thing to go thru, i dont wish this on anyone.</p><a title="♬ original sound - Ivynichole" href=#>♬ original sound - Ivynichole</a></figure><p>Her missing items include, among other things, her painting canvasses which serve as her livelihood.</p><p>To make matters worse, though, apartment management supposedly were only willing to offer her $2,000 to $3,000 for reparations.</p><p>"How is that gonna cover everything that I lost?" Ivy stresses. "How is that gonna give me the chance to start over?"</p><p>From there, they were apparently only willing to offer her $5,000 at most.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@ivynicholeee href=#>@ivynicholeee</a><p>Sorry im late but here is part 2, i also have to upload oart 3 which is the last part</p><a title="♬ original sound - Ivynichole" href=#>♬ original sound - Ivynichole</a></figure><p>In the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">third part</a> of her explanation, she mentioned that a relative would soon reach out to the landlord to try and sort out her situation. However, the emotional damage has already been done.</p><p>"I'm very grateful for anything that comes my way," she declares. "But when there's something [taken] from me and I'm not being treated with respect ... it just doesn't sit right with me."</p><p>As of this writing, there have been no updates on her living situation. Folks in the comments urge her to go to court with management if she doesn't receive satisfaction.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc2sZKunn6K6osDEZpyvoZOpsqV5wa6rZqSRo7Gtu9GdZK2goprEbrvUrWShnaJiwLXBxZ8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
