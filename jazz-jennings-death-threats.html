"I've experienced a lot of mental health issues and sometimes the anxiety just takes over," she tells the cameras. In another scene, she's reading aloud threats and slurs directed at her social media pages with friends.</p><p>During the most tense point of the trailer, Jazz admits to her friends, "Someone wants to kill me. Just for being transgender." The scene then cuts to her mother, Jeanette, saying, "Look at me. This is serious." In voiceover, Jeanette says, "We've experienced death threats before. But this is different. There's a person out there that knows where she lives."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Jeanette adds, "I'm absolutely terrified because there's no timeline on a death threat." Jazz, on the other hand, feels comfortable at Harvard, saying, "I do feel protected at school. I think they have my back and they're going to handle any situation," she says. "But it is really, really scary. And it's sad that we live in a world where people want to kill others just for being who they are."</p><p>Speaking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People,</a> Jazz elaborated on the types of threats she sees on her social media simply for existing: "I get death threats almost on a daily basis. People will comment on my photos saying, 'Burn in hell. Kill yourself. You're an abomination.'"</p><p>She added, "But when someone sends a threat to where you live and they know your location, it's a really, really scary feeling knowing that someone is kind of stalking you a little bit and they have these ill intentions."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jazz (@jazzjennings_)</a></p></figure><p>Previously, Jazz took a break from Harvard University after struggling with her mental health.
