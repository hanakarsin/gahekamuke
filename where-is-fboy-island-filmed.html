The reality dating competition has switched up locations for all three seasons. Here's where they each take place.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The CW</span></figure><p>Alexa, play “Love Galore” by SZA.</p><p>Dealing with a f---boy is a headache within itself. These men do a great job of playing a good game only to have their selfish needs met in the end. And as for you, you’ll be left with a Texas-sized heartbreak and regret.</p><p>In other words, avoiding f---boys at all costs is the only way you’ll maintain peace of mind in your dating life. And of course, <a href=#>FBoy Island </a>has shown us all the importance of choosing a partner wisely.</p><p>In case you’ve been out of the loop, FBoy Island is back for <a href=#>Season 3</a> on its new home on The CW. The popular dating show gives three eligible women the opportunity to weed the titular FBoys out from a group of nice guys who are looking for a romantic connection.</p><p>But of course, nothing says romance like a tropical oasis and FBoy Island’s showrunners have pulled out all the stops for their filming locations. So, where exactly is FBoy Island filmed? Here’s what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The CW</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">‘FBoy Island’ has changed filming locations every season.</h2><p>Who doesn’t love a taste of the tropics? It’s no secret that FBoy Island was filmed in exotic tropical locations. Season 3, which premiered on Oct. 16, 2023, was filmed in a tropical part of Los Angeles County.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Palm Beach</a> writes that despite the gorgeous villas in which the participants are staying and getting to know each other, Season 3's local is a "major step down" from previous filming locations.</p><p>Season 2 of the reality series was filmed in Mexico, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheCinemaholic</a>.</p><p>The outlet previously shared that the majority of the scenes on the show were primarily filmed at Cabo San Lucas. If the city sounds familiar to you, that’s because films like 2005’s The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, 2006’s Bad Girls Club, and Laguna Beach were filmed at the touristy location.</p><p>TheCinemaholic also shares that the principal photography for the show was done at Baja California Sur. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">VisitMexico</a>, Baja California Sur is known to have warm weather nearly all year round and is home to a mix of activities that include scuba diving, sailing, fishing, and more.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBOMax</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 1 of ‘FBoy Island’ was filmed in the Cayman Islands.</h2><p>Season 1 could even be said to be more glamorous than the proceeding filming locations combined. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TVOverMind</a>, Originally, FBoy Island called the Cayman Islands home. Anyone who has traveled to the Cayman Islands would say how gorgeous the islands are, which is perfect for a reality dating show.</p><p>The islands were already a vacation hotspot, but the location saw a surge in popularity following the lift of travel restrictions post-pandemic. It’s unclear why showrunners decided to opt for Mexico for Season 2, let alone go through a downgrade for Season 3.</p><p>New episodes for Season 3 of FBoy Island premiere every Monday at 8 p.m. EST on The CW.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxllpe8unnIrKOappRis6q4zJ6b</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
