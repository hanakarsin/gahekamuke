Here's what we know about the TikTok star.</h2><p>Fedha Sinon, better known as Pinkydoll (@pinkydollreal) on <a href=#>TikTok</a> is a Canada-based 19-year-old internet star who quickly gained popularity by pioneering the strange world of <a href=#>NPC streaming</a>.</p><p>In case you aren't aware, NPC streams are exactly what they sound like. People go live on platforms like TikTok to literally behave like non-player characters from video games by looping motions and phrases with startlingly repetitive accuracy.</p><p>These streams have been growing in popularity over the past several months, with fans inexplicably mesmerized by NPC streamers' uncanny repetitive movements and surreal body language.</p><p>Pinkydoll is thought to be the trendsetter for the whole thing and is easily one of the most popular NPC streamers in the business today. As of this writing, she currently has over 538,000 followers on TikTok with over 1.8 million likes across her videos.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>But how does that translate to her bank account? There are currently no official reports on her overall net worth, but she's undeniably earning that cheddar.</p><p>She makes most of her money through TikTok LIVE, where audience members can offer monetary Gifts that can be converted into actual money. During her streams, viewers can send her Gifts while she goes through her NPC loops live.</p><p>Her livestreams typically reach hundreds of thousands of viewers, many of whom contribute their own money to support her. She reportedly earns over <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$7,000</a> per day thanks to these streams too. Even though her net worth has yet to be made public, $7,000 for every stream is certainly nothing to sneeze at.</p><p>It may be strange to look at for some, but Pinkydoll's regular NPC streams appear to be wildly lucrative for her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbavt9idpqWkXam2rMDOpGSnnaRixLC%2B06E%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
