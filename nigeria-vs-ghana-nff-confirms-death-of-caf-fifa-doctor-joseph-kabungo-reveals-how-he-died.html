But he didn’t make it. He died just as they got to the hospital.”</p><p>Salami went on to state that the incident happened when Kabungo was looking to get a player for the doping exercise as required.</p><p>“It was at this same time that Kabungo was looking to get the Ghanaian player for the same exercise.</p><p>“But as I was heading to the dressing room of the Nigerian team, the General Coordinator, Kabore Bosilong from South Africa, called my attention.</p><p>“Kabungo suddenly started gasping for breath. The match’s FIFA Security Officer, Dixon Okello from Uganda, also witnessed the incident.</p><p>“We tried to resuscitate him there and then, but when this did not appear to be working, we put him in an ambulance and rushed him to Cedar Crest Hospital in Apo, where he gave up the ghost.</p><p>“It is a very sad incident and one is shocked that some persons have been putting a terrible slant to the whole thing by saying he was beaten up by fans.
