There have been a few newbies here and there, and now Season 8 has welcomed YouTuber Brett Caprioni into the fold. Because not only is he experienced in all things vegan and vlogging, but apparently, he‚Äôs a bartender too. Brett is essentially a triple threat and part of his charm is going to be spent being at the center of some romance drama this season.</p><p>But because he‚Äôs so new to the world of Vanderpump Rules, there‚Äôs a lot fans don't yet know about Brett. Like where he‚Äôs from, how he found himself cast on the show in its eighth season, and how much of a future he has at SUR. Because despite being no stranger to the camera via YouTube, Brett is brand new to reality TV.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Where is Brett on 'Vanderpump Rules' from?</h2><p>According to Brett‚Äôs Bravo bio for Vanderpump Rules, he is originally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>from New Jersey</u></a>. Because SUR is located in West Hollywood, Calif., it means Brett is definitely far from home. And even though he has experience with cameras in some capacity, he‚Äôs kind of a fish out of water. His move was brought about because of a breakup, so hopefully he can get a fresh start on the West Coast at SUR.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">He already has a small fan base.</h2><p>Before Brett was cast on Vanderpump Rules, he was already internet famous, thanks to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>his YouTube channel</u></a>. He regularly posts vlogs or videos about vegan recipes and he has more than 500,000 subscribers, so he‚Äôs the real deal. It might be part of what Lisa Vanderpump saw in him as a new bartender, but he did go through training just like everyone else. In fact, Jax Taylor told Life & Style that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>he trained</u></a> the newest SUR bartender himself.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>"He‚Äôs a YouTuber, but needed part-time money so he wanted to bartend, so I‚Äôm kind of teaching him a little about that," Jax said, of taking Brett under his wing, so to speak. "Believe it or not, I‚Äôm teaching him, which is kind of weird because I‚Äôm a terrible bartender. But been there 10 years and I finally get to teach people."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Brett may be involved in a love triangle or two this season.</h2><p>Although Brett‚Äôs Bravo bio says that he is in a not-so-platonic flirtmance with fellow Vanderpump Rules star Scheana Shay, he also has interest in Dayna Kathan, who used to have a thing with Max Boyens, Brett‚Äôs good friend. If Brett pursues something with Dayna, his friendship with Max would definitely suffer. And if Scheana pursues something with Brett at the same time, he could find himself in a love square of sorts.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Does this fit suit me??? ü•¥üï∫üèª</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Brett Cap</a> (@brettcap) on Aug 25, 2019 at 5:55pm PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">James Kennedy is a fan.</h2><p>Even if Brett gets off to a rocky start amidst his newfound reality TV stardom, he likely made some friends while filming Vanderpump Rules Season 8. In October 2019, James Kennedy posted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a selfie with Brett</u></a> on Instagram with the caption, "Season 8 coming in hot." So even if Brett doesn‚Äôt make it to Season 9, he likely made an impression with a handful of his SUR co-workers and Vanderpump Rules co-stars.</p><p>Watch Vanderpump Rules on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlkqeytcCMr5innJWnvba5z2aprqSVqHqnvs6m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
