As the saying goes, "no publicity is bad publicity." There are exceptions to that rule, however. Like remember all of the tech writers who honestly thought <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that the iPhone was going to fail</a> when it first was released? Sure, there were plenty of better offerings at the time capable of way more than the iPhone could do, but they didn't have huge capacitive glass-coated touch screens on them.</p><p>There are some publications, however, that don't mind re-living the controversy that was stirred up when they first published some articles. I published a pretty scathing list of lame boyfriend hobbies a few years ago when I first started at Distractify, and the amount of ire I received on Facebook for the comments were definitely worth the amount of people who were talking about the article.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I've Cheated on Every Boyfriend I've Ever Had, and I Don't Regret It <a href=#>https://t.co/OOy3bKIuXs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/s25dlA2upq</a></p>— Cosmopolitan (@Cosmopolitan) <a href=#>June 26, 2019</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>So I guess I get where Cosmopolitan is coming from when they publish an article with the following title: "I've Cheated on Every Boyfriend I've Ever Had, and I Don't Regret it." The tag line? "And if you're in your early 20s, this writer recommends you do the same."</p><p>Cosmopolitan first shared this story on social media back in 2019. You know, the same year the Notre Dame Cathedral went up in flames and Hong Kong protesters were dying for their right to exist.</p><p>While there were other notable news stories that occurred on that specific day — ike photos of a migrant father and his child dying as they tried to cross the Rio Grande, Illinois legalizing the use of recreational marijuana, or Twitter user @saulmalone asking "what the f*** is up Delilah? What the F*** is it like in New York City?" — Twitter was very concerned with Cosmo's post.</p><p>There was an outpour of negative responses to the publication's decision to disseminate a story many criticized as being "trashy."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>why would you publish something this psychotic</p>— cool alien guy (@rogowhiskey) <a href=#>June 28, 2019</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Not nice!

The response was similar, with commenters leaving barf emojis and people rekindling their ire for the post. However, it did seem like Cosmo was intentionally responding to goad certain users into commenting more, or providing responses that people thought were "petty" and "lame."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>While there were many individuals who claimed that people who were negatively commenting on the post didn't read the full article, many countered that they had read the article and didn't buy the writer's "justifications" for cheating on their boyfriend.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Some argued that the writer of the article was still just promoting "toxic" behavior and using their adolescence/youth as a crutch for having a terrible personality and outlook on life.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Others argued that if someone just wanted to constantly cheat, then it's better they don't have a significant other or simply find a partner who is also willing to have an open relationship.</p><p>And then there were throngs of others who stated that they would be unfollowing Cosmo's Instagram account for good and wouldn't purchase any more of the outlet's content.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there's a ton of research on the topic of infidelity</a> — with many psychologists indicating that adulterers, even in marriages, may have valid feelings in wanting to seek romance elsewhere — almost everyone agrees that the adverse emotional effects on their significant other is a betrayal of trust to inflict upon someone.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Twitter's got plenty of thoughts about cheating on significant others outside of that Twitter post.
