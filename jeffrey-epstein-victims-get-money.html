He was arrested on charges of sex trafficking minors in both New York and Florida, and after his arrest, many questions arose regarding the hundreds of millions of dollars in his bank account.&nbsp;</p><p>During the initial stages of the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, prosecutors confirmed that they were able to determine Epstein's net worth using documents they received from financial institutions where he was affiliated.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Jeffrey Edward Epstein - in the 90s, Jeffrey's face and name was everywhere, this billionaire bachelor that was all the craze but no one knew how he came to his wealth. with his abundance of cash, he had bought quite a few properties; •358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach Florida. (slide 6), purchased for $2,500,000 in 1990. •Little St. James Island, US Virgin Islands. (slide 7) purchased for $7,950,000 in 1990, valued now at $63,000,000. •Zoro Ranch, New Mexico. (slide 8) purchased for $12,000,000. •Townhouse, 9 East 71st Street, New York. Records show that the title for this Beaux Arts mansion was transferred to Epstein from his sometime mentor and client Les Wexner in 1996 for $0. Jeffrey would invite underage girls to his house, and say to them he would pay them $200 for a massage, he would then ask the girls to remove their clothing and/ or start masturbating infront of them, from all accounts the girls were disgusted and didn't know how to react, he would involve them in sexual acts, prostitute them and also bring them to his island for orgies allegedly with big figure heads like Prince Andrew, Naomi Campbell, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Chris Tucker. he would have his girlfriend of the time (who is now on the run), ghislaine maxwell aswell as his secretary Sarah kellen to scout and recruit young girls for him and his friends. In 2005, police in&nbsp;Palm Beach, Florida, began investigating Epstein, he then pleaded guilty and was convicted in 2008 by a Florida state court of procuring an&nbsp;underage girl for prostitution&nbsp;and of soliciting a prostitute; federal officials had in fact identified 36&nbsp;girls, some as young as 14 years old. Epstein was arrested again on July 6, 2019, on federal charges for the&nbsp;sex trafficking&nbsp;of minors in Florida and New York.&nbsp;He died in his jail cell&nbsp;on August 10, 2019.The medical examiner ruled the death as suicide, however alot of the Internet believe he was killed by his friends of high rank to ensure his silence and their freedom. written by: @laythsantana</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Cyber's Gate</a> (@cybersgate) on Jun 5, 2020 at 7:43am PDT</p></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>USA Today</u></a>, his total assets were $559,120,954 as of June 30, 2019.
