We're taking a look at each supervillain's stats to see if we can tell.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: DC Comics</span></figure><p>Like <a href=#>Batman vs. Superman</a>, comic book fans love to pit certain characters against each other to see who might come out victorious in a fight. One such pair is that of Trigon and Darkseid, two DC supervillains that possess similarly terrifying powers. The age-old question must be asked, however: who would win in a fight? Which character is actually more powerful? There's no clear-cut answer, of course, but we can certainly investigate both characters.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're a fan of both characters and want a look into their unique attributes, you might want to take a moment and go through all of this with us. You might be surprised at the conclusion you end up coming to. But be forewarned: There's no measuring characters' powers accurately like this, because you never know what kind of secrets they might be hiding up their sleeves. We're going to give it the old college try to investigate, though.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: DC Comics</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who's more powerful, Trigon or Darkseid?</h2><p>If we want to answer this question, we first have to take a look at both characters. Let's start with Trigon. The supervillain is heralded as one of the most powerful beings in the DC Universe (along with Darkseid), and is the archenemy of the Justice League and the Teen Titans. His true form is a red demon with four eyes, horns, and a cape-like outfit. He's a cruel and dangerous interdimensional demon who you certainly don't want to meet down a dark alleyway in the middle of the night, or ever.</p><p>On the other side, Darkseid is also a supervillain, and the ruler of the planet Apokolips. He's aiming to ultimately conquer the universe and eliminate free will as well as sentient beings. He's also considered one of the most powerful villains in the DC Universe. His appearance is fairly unremarkable, as he's normally pictured wearing a blue outfit with gauntlets and boots. Apparently, his personality was even inspired by Adolf Hitler.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: DC Comics</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, who would win in a fight — Trigon or Darkseid?</h2><p>This is a question that we really can't answer definitively. Also, the characters haven't actually crossed paths in the context of any DC Comics properties. Darkseid is a New God as well, which means he has infinite power, while Trigon is simply a demon.&nbsp;</p><p>Darkseid also has an entire planet and army of parademons at his disposal, which are all extremely powerful on their own. You've got to take all their powers and abilities into account, so it's unclear which set of abilities are more impressive.</p><p>Declaring a winner here would be much like comparing the pair to Batman versus Superman, as previously stated. They both have a wide variety of different powers and abilities, and without seeing them go at it and have some sort of metric, we can't say. But our money would be on Darkseid, for what it's worth. Of course, that could be our pathetic mortal souls trying to curry favor to get on his good side.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuwNGinqimXajBs7vNoJyrZaSdrq95w5qppKuVnrE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
