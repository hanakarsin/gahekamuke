Hosted by <a href=#>Nick and Vanessa Lachey,</a> the show follows a group of singles as they date in pods where they can only talk to each other. If they hit it off, they can decide to do the unthinkable and get engaged without ever seeing what the other person looks like.</p><p>After 10 days, the pods close and the newly engaged couples finally get to meet face to face /be with one another in real life to find out if their physical connection is just as strong as the emotional one they developed in the pods. But time is of the essence as their weddings will occur exactly a month after they got engaged. And as we've seen in past seasons, not all engaged couples end up going through with their weddings.</p><p>But enough about the past seasons. Let's talk about this season. The first four episodes of <a href=#>Season 5</a> will arrive on Netflix on Sept. 22, 2023. Below, we share all the details of when and where these episodes were filmed. Plus, what we know about the romantic trip the couples were sent on to celebrate their engagements.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Nick and Vanessa Lachey in Houston, Texas for Season 5 of 'Love is Blind'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where was Season 5 of 'Love Is Blind' filmed?</h2><p>Season 5 of Love Is Blind was filmed in Houston, Texas, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a>.
