The development was driven by the 45.5 per cent and 14.4 per cent lower inflow through the CBN and the autonomous sources, respectively.</p><p>“Foreign exchange inflow through the Bank at $9.18bn fell below the $16.83bn in the preceding quarter as both oil and non-oil receipts declined, as a result of lower receipts from interest on reserves and interbank swaps.”</p><p>A disaggregation showed that proceeds from oil-related sources declined by 12.2 per cent to $1.63bn, relative to the preceding period.</p><p>Also, receipts from non-oil sources fell to $7.54bn, compared with $14.97bn in the preceding quarter.</p><p>Foreign exchange inflow through autonomous sources declined to $11.44bn, relative to $13.37bn in the preceding period, driven mainly by a reduction in over-the-counter purchases and non-oil export receipts.</p><p>Foreign exchange outflow through the economy rose by 19.4 per cent to $12.21bn, relative to the level in the preceding quarter, majorly on account of increased foreign exchange intervention and utilisation for visible imports.</p><p>Outflow through the CBN stood at $10.58bn, indicating a 32.5 per cent increase, relative to $7.98bn in the preceding quarter.</p><p>This is attributable to increased sales to the I&E window, third-party MDA transfers, public sector direct payments, and Joint Venture cash call payments.</p><p>However, autonomous outflow decreased by 27.2 per cent to $1.63bn, due to lower utilisation of foreign exchange for invisible imports.</p><p>Consequently, the economy recorded a lower net inflow of $8.41bn in the fourth quarter, compared with $19.98bn in the preceding quarter, reflecting the lower net inflow of $9.81bn recorded through autonomous sources.</p><p>In contrast, a net outflow of $1.4bn was recorded through the CBN, compared with a net inflow of $8.85bn in the preceding quarter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e5FwZp6bn6O8rrXCZpqroaOewG7DzquqnqajYq60ecWoqZ6wXZ67p7jOsKpmnpGhuW6u2GZwZm1ol7tw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
