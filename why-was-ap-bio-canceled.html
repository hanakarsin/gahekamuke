Bio'/YouTube</a></figure><p>The comedy <a href=#>A.P. Bio</a> is all about a Harvard philosophy professor named Jack Griffin (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Glenn Howerton) who's found himself back in his hometown of Toledo, Ohio, teaching biology after losing out at his dream job to his rival Miles Leonard (Tom Bennett). But instead of teaching them any bio, he uses his position and the <a href=#>honor students</a> he "teaches" to get revenge.</p><p>Fans of the show love it even though it's struggled to stay alive — and now, sadly, it has been canceled. But why? Unfortunately for the show, this isn't the first time it's been given the ax. It lasted two seasons on NBC before it was said to be over. Then, it was picked up by Peacock and made it to Season 4 before it was announced that the show was ending once again and wouldn't be returning for a fifth season.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why was 'A.P. Bio' canceled?</h2><p>An official reason for the show's cancelation hasn't been given yet. But both Peacock and the show's creator, Mike O’Brien, have both released statements about what's happened. In a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>, the streaming service said it was glad it could give fans more of A.P. Bio and that it was "grateful" to Mike. But in Mike's statement, he said he was "sad" to see the show go.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: 'A.P.

"This show has been one of the best experiences of my life and that’s because of the hundreds of hilarious, hard-working, positive people that were involved," he wrote. In follow-up tweets, he mentions tons of people on the team and thanks them all for their hard work.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'A.P. Bio' was canceled once before.</h2><p>Initially, A.P. Bio was a show on NBC, but it was canceled after two seasons in 2019. Back then, Mike also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released a statement via Twitter</a> about the show being canceled. "This has been my favorite project of my life and that's because of the amazing writers, cast, and crew," he said, adding that he believed that he and the crew working on the show "were just hitting our stride" when the show first ended.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'm intensely sad to announce that AP Bio will be ending after this season.
