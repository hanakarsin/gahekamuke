Let's face it, with the <a href=#>eye-popping price point of caviar</a>, it's easy to associate the fish eggs with the rich and famous. Caviar bump, anyone?</p><p>While Pringles have been a staple in my household since I can remember, I, like many other social media users, was "caviar-curious."</p><p>Therefore, I couldn't wait to get my hands on the Crisps and Caviar Collection kits that The Caviar Co. and Pringles launched. The three kits feature a variety of pairings which include Pringles Original, Sour Cream & Onion, and BBQ flavors with Classic White Sturgeon Caviar and Smoked Trout Roe.</p><p>While some caviar tastings can certainly cost a few hundred dollars, those who are looking for an elevated snack experience or are curious to try caviar for the first time will not break the bank purchasing one of these kits: The Pringles x The Caviar Co. Smoky Shores ($49), Pringles x The Caviar Co. Salt of The Sea ($110), Pringles x The Caviar Co. â€˜Crisps and Caviarâ€™ Flight ($140).</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Courtesy/Pringles X The Caviar Co.</span></figure><p style=text-align:left>I tried the â€˜Crisps and Caviarâ€™ Flight which features all three Pringles flavors and the Classic White Sturgeon Caviar and Smoked Trout Roe. So, is this caviar kit worth the price point? Am I now jumping on the #CaviarTok TikTok trend?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">I tried Pringles x The Caviar Co. â€˜Crisps and Caviarâ€™ flight.</h2><p>Honestly, I've never had caviar before in my life, so I did not know what to expect in terms of the flavor profile. While I do enjoy seafood, I've only ever heard about the "saltiness" of caviar and wondered how that would pair with a snack food such as Pringles.</p><p>Starting off with the Classic White Sturgeon Caviar, which is known as the "sea butter of caviar," I preferred this on Pringles Sour Cream & Onion. Though it did have a slightly salty flavor, it was creamy and was complimented by the flavor profile of the Sour Cream & Onion Pringles.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@pringles href=#>@pringles</a><p>Introducing the â€˜Crisps and Caviar Collectionâ€™ from Pringles and @TheCaviarCo. Get yours at PringlesAndCaviar.shop <a title=pringlesandcaviar href=#>#pringlesandcaviar</a> <a title=pringles href=#>#pringles</a> ðŸ“·:@josephcweaver</p><a title="â™¬ original sound - Pringles" href=#>â™¬ original sound - Pringles</a></figure><p>The BBQ Pringles altered the flavor of the White Sturgeon so it was definitely my least favorite of the three flavor pairings. For anyone who does not love an overly fishy taste, the Classic White Sturgeon Caviar and Sour Cream & Onion Pringles is a delicious elevated snack food that will surely delight your tastebuds or impress your friends and family at a party.</p><p>The Smoked Trout caviar definitely reminded me of smoked salmon so I didn't mind the fishy flavor. However, unlike the Classic White Sturgeon, I preferred the Smoke Trout and BBQ Pringles pairing. The BBQ dusting changed the Smoked Trout flavor, which made for a sweeter and milder fish note.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Courtesy/Pringles X The Caviar Co.</span></figure><p>Overall, I can't help but love the fusion of high-low brow food. And these caviar kits make for a great holiday gift, or for you to enjoy with your friends at a house party. Plus, if you're like me and have never had caviar, these kits make for a fun introduction. Therefore, I am definitely a fan of this social media trend.</p><p>You can shop for the Pringles x The Caviar Co. kits <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> while supplies last.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLJuwNGinJ1loKe2r7PLnqpmmZ6ZeqSt1aKYqw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
