The report also noted that with or without treatment, "heart failure is often and typically progressive, meaning it gradually gets worse."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Harry is arguably the most successful Caribbean American singer, popularizing Jamaican mento folk songs in the 1950s; his breakthrough album "Calypso" was the first million-selling record by a single artist. Harry performed in many genres, including show tunes, blues, and gospel. In 2022, the "Banana Boat Song" crooner was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</p><p>The EGOT winner also found major success as an actor, starring in films like Carmen Jones, Island in the Sun,<strong> </strong>Odds Against Tomorrow, and the Oscar-winning biographical black comedy crime picture BlacKkKlansman.</p><p>But perhaps Harry is best known for his activism — he was a close friend of Martin Luther King Jr., offering financial support to the civil rights leader and his family with his personal funds during the Civil Rights Movement of the late '50s and '60s. Harry also funded the Freedom Riders and the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee. Harry also played a pivotal role in organizing the historic March on Washington on Aug. 28, 1963.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Harry Belafonte set the standard for engaged, principled, and informed celebrity activism.
