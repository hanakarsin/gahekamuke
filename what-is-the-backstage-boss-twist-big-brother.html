Well, what is it? Here's everything we know so far.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p><strong>Spoiler alert: This article contains spoilers for Season 24 of</strong> <strong>Big Brother.</strong></p><p>During the premiere of <a href=#>Big Brother 24</a>, the phrase "expect the unexpected" hit us like a freight train.</p><p>Throughout the episode, our trusty host â€” <a href=#>Julie Chen Moonves</a> â€” informed viewers to stick around until the end of the night, as she would reveal an all-new twist to the houseguests who would surely shake up the game. And boy, was she right.</p><p>If you recall, Joe "Pooch" Pucciarelli selected the Backstage Boss ticket at "BB Fest" during the Season 24 premiere. He then received a pass alongside some pretty incredible powers for the first week of the competition.</p><p>With that said, what is the Backstage Boss twist? Let's find out!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the Backstage Boss twist on 'Big Brother'?</h2><p>Once Pooch discovered he had the Backstage Boss ticket, he was told to take a seat on the massive golden throne â€” unbelievably similar to that of the gold chair in Big Brother 7 (UK) â€” and await further instruction.</p><p>Following the HoH competition (find out who won <a href=#>here</a>), Julie officially spilled the beans on the Backstage Boss twist.</p><p>Since he claimed the Backstage Boss ticket, Julie informed Pooch that he was sent "backstage" and received immunity for the entire first week. As a result, Pooch can not be nominated for eviction. But there's a catch. Pooch is ineligible to compete in any Week 1 competitions and will not be allowed to vote in the first eviction of the summer.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>If you thought this twist only affected one houseguest, you forgot to "expect the unexpected." Julie soon announced another aspect of the Backstage Boss twist. Pooch had to choose three other houseguests to join him "backstage." In the end, Pooch selected Paloma, Alyssa, and Brittany.</p><p>Although the trio also can't be nominated, play in the week's competitions, or vote on eviction night, one of them could still be sent out the front door. Luckily, one of them can be saved via <a href=#>America's Vote</a>!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">America can vote to save one of Pooch's picks.</h2><p>The twists are never-ending. At the end of the Season 24 premiere of Big Brother, viewers at home discovered that they have more influence on the game than usual, thanks to the iconic twist known as America's Vote.</p><p>"America, you have the power to impact the game on night one," Julie surprisingly announced. "Which one of these three houseguests do you want to keep safe? The power is in your hands."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pooch makes his backstage selections ..
