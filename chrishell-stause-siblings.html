"They have been married so long and they have this beautiful family," Chrishell said of Shonda, her husband, and their children during Season 3.</p><p>"I just think it's really hard to be around because that's what I wanted and that's what I am realizing I don't have, but it helps me be inspired to know that it might be out there. It just may take a different path than what I was thinking," she continued.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chrishell Stause also has a younger sister named Sabrina Stause.</h2><p>Chrishell Stause's younger sister Sabrina Stause has never been featured on Selling Sunset before, but she has frequently been seen in photos with Chrishell.

However, she chooses to go by her middle name, Chrishell, which her mom came up with after giving birth to her at a Shell station with the help of an attendant named Chris.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chrishell Stause and her sisters were homeless several times during their childhood.</h2><p>On Selling Sunset, Chrishell sells multi-million dollar houses to clients — something she and her sisters couldn't even fathom as children. Sadly, the three girls grew up in poverty in Kentucky. At various times during her childhood, Chrishell shared that her family had nowhere to live. However. she never let this bring her down — Chrishell kept looking ahead to better days. One thing she enjoyed doing as a kid was watching soap operas and admiring the women on the screen.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“They seemed like the exact opposite of my life. So I wanted to be that," she further told Bustle.</p><p>In 2003, Chrishell moved to L.A. and by 2005, she landed a role on the ABC soap opera, All My Children, which she would hold until the show's 2011 cancellation. Two years later, she'd join the cast of Days of Our Lives as physical therapist Jordan Ridgeway — a character she’d play on and off over the years.</p><p>Despite all her success, Chrishell still constantly worried about money.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She wanted a job that she could do in between filming episodes for ABC — something like real estate.</p><p>"I don’t want to feel like I’m ever in a situation where I can get things taken away from me and I have to go back to a life where I can’t just stand on my own two feet," she said. As someone who has experienced homelessness in the past, entering real estate had “a romance to it. I like the idea of matchmaking people with houses."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Fortunately, it all worked out perfectly for Chrishell. The Selling Sunset star currently lives in L.A. and just purchased her first house, as shown in Season 4. Meanwhile, her sisters Shonda and Sabrina reside in their native state of Kentucky.
