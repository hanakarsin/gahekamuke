The weather was so hot that the referee had to give the players a “cooling break” in the second half.</p><p>After the disappointing draw, coach Jose Peseiro said: “Playing at 2 pm isn’t easy, so the temperature and humidity were not good, but our players managed it very well. It wasn’t easy playing in these conditions.”</p><p>Aside from the weather conditions that probably cost the Super Eagles the maximum three points, the team also failed to take advantage of their numerous goalscoring opportunities.</p><p>For instance, Victor Osimhen had more than one goalscoring opportunity but he failed to score. Also, Zaidu Sanusi missed a glorious chance because he was impatient in the box.</p><p>“We did everything to win, we created many and clear opportunities, and we simply deserved to win,” Jose Peseiro said.</p><p>No thanks to the draw, Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea trail Ivory Coast in Group A <a href=# rel=noopener>following the hosts’ 2-0 victory against Guinea-Bissau</a> in their opening encounter on Saturday. Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria both have one point, while the hosts lead the group with three points.</p><p>As it stands, the Super Eagles of Nigeria are condemned to beat Ivory Coast in their second Group A game on Thursday, January 18.</p><p>A win for Nigeria will get their campaign back on track while a draw will require them to win their last group game against Guinea-Bissau next Monday to be confident of making it to the round of 16.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5BuZqytoJq%2FbrHAoKOeq12YvKKvx2ahqKuVYr2mv8SiqahlmJa2rb%2BMoaCsZaChrrqx0axkmp6kmr9ufYxqZJ2qkax8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
