The recent overhaul (introduction of CBC) is a massive gain for learners. And Kenya High, one of the most renowned high schools in Kenya, is a leader in offering the best platform for students.</p><p class=align-left>However, if you are interested in the school for your child, it is integral that you learn about its admission criteria and cost. So, what marks does one require to join Kenya High?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/74d6c10bd39d949b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenton College Preparatory School: fees structure, location, and curriculum</span></p></a><h2>About Kenya High School</h2><p class=align-left>Kenya High is located in Kileleshwa, a posh Nairobian suburb ranks among the top national public girls' schools. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">learning institution</a> was formerly known as Nairobi European School and was established in 1910. It later became a girl’s school in 1932.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: Don't miss trending Kenyan news. Follow TUKO.co.ke on <a id=https://twitter.com/Tuko_co_ke href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>!</strong></p><p class=align-left>The segregation of learners saw it called European Girls Secondary School, with Miss Kerby as the school's first head in 1935. The learning institution was renamed Kenya High School and was later acquired by the Kenyan government in 1974. The change in management allowed the school to admit more African pupils.</p><p class=align-left>Also, the school got its first headmistress, Mrs. R. Kariuki, in 1977, taking over from Miss Barnes. However, she only headed the learning centre for a few months leaving in July of the same year, handing it over to M. W. Wanjohi.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9afc821a5c04d6e2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Pangani Girls: fees structure, KCSE performance, uniform, location</span></p></a><p class=align-left>With the surging enrollment rate, Kenya High School fees became competitive compared to other <a href=#>secondary schools</a> of its calibre.</p><p class=align-left>Students in the learning institution increased over time. In the late 1930s, Kenya High had only 35 students. The number increased in the 40s to 150 and then 500 in the 50s. Today, the well-performing school attracts students from different parts of the country and has a population of more than 1,300 students.</p><p class=align-left>Kenya High has been a top performer among national schools in Kenya for several decades. The institution has over ten dormitories, named after legendary European women, each with a capacity of 130 students.</p><h2>Kenya High School admission requirements</h2><p class=align-left>What are the Kenya High School entry marks? The outspoken high school with a rich history is a <a href=#>national school</a>, which means that entry is regulated by the government's directive on the cut off points for national schools in Kenya. Also, it is essential to note that these cut off points alter every year based on performance and subscription.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/fe0539f1bce2ea96.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 best national girl schools in Kenya 2024/2025 ranked by performance</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Regardless of the government's directive on the cut off points, if you want to be on the safe side, score 400 marks and above in your KCPE.</p><p class=align-left>However, it is still unclear how students under the new CBC system will transition to the learning institution considering the structures are quite different from 8-4-4. Students from marginalized areas can join Kenya High School with 320 marks and above.</p><h2>Kenya High enrolment procedure</h2><p class=align-left>Students earn slots via the nationwide selection process. Once the process is done, learners can download their admission letters via the ministry's online portal.</p><p class=align-left>If you had applied to the school, used the appropriate <a href=#>KNEC</a> code and attained the right marks, you are sure to get an admission here.</p><p class=align-left>The admission letter will have all the details of the school required when reporting. All you need to do to access your letter is enter your index number on the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">official portal </a>for form one selections, choose your county and sub-county, and then click submit.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/047813825febb481.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of national schools in Kiambu County ranked by performance</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Take your admission letter to your primary school’s headteacher for endorsement.

As a public high school, Kenya High has to comply with the Kenya secondary school <a href=#>fees structure</a> unveiled by the Ministry of Education.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1d7ded1c42e8a564.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nova Pioneer school fees, curriculum, performance, location, uniform</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Recent secondary school fee guidelines show the commitment of the Ministry of Education to offering free secondary education. The government will cater for most costs incurred in routine learning activities.</p><p class=align-left>Since Kenya High is a boarding secondary school, the government provides capitation for each learner equal to capitation for every learner in a day school.</p><p class=align-left>Also, parents are meant to pay the boarding fees applicable to the school to meet the cost of boarding. And this boarding fee varies for different categories of schools.</p><p class=align-left>Kenya High is under category A and has the following fees:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/74d6c10bd39d949b.jpeg><p class=align-left>The school’s total payable fee is KShs. 67,244. Parents pay <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a larger share</a> of KSh. 45,000 while the government pays KShs. 22,244 per student.</p><p class=align-left>The government has achieved tremendous results in waiving the cost of education across all public schools.
