But when is first-person mode coming to 'Fortnite'? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fortnite</span></figure><p>Unlike other battle royale games such as Call of Duty: Warzone and <a href=#>Apex Legends,</a> <a href=#>Fortnite</a> is a third-person shooter. And since launching in 2017, thatâ€™s always been the case. Things might be changing this season, however, as rumors are swirling about a possible first-person mode in Fortnite.</p><p>But are these rumors about a change in perspective true? And if so, when is first-person mode coming to Fortnite?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When is first-person mode coming to 'Fortnite'?</h2><p>Epic Games has not officially confirmed that a first-person game mode is in development for Fortnite. That means no one truly knows when a first-person mode will be coming to Fortnite. Rumors and leaks flooded the internet as we inched closer to the launch of Chapter 4 Season 2 â€“ but now that weâ€™re a few weeks into the season, nothing new has surfaced.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Epic Games</span></figure><p>A few of these leaks seem highly plausible, however, and come from historically reliable sources. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HYPEX</a> is a particularly notable source, as the Fortnite expert has built up an impressive community on Twitter with more than 2.5 million followers. They claimed that a first-person mode would arrive in Chapter 4 Season 2.</p><p>And just because the mode wasnâ€™t available at launch doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™ll never see the light of day. Epic often introduces big changes halfway through a season â€“ so be on the lookout in the coming weeks for the arrival of a first-person mode.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Fortnite's First Person mode is finally coming in NEXT SEASON ðŸ”¥</p><p>The same reliable source confirmed it to me & <a href=#>@ShiinaBR</a>, and now <a href=#>@GMatrixGames</a> & <a href=#>@iFireMonkey</a> got confirmation from their side too. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/SASj2E6TRS</a></p>â€” HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href=#>March 4, 2023</a></figure><p>It's unclear if this first-person perspective would be introduced as a standalone game mode like Zero Build, or if it would be a toggle in the settings that lets you change your perspective on the fly. Folks playing in third-person have a clear advantage over first-person players (third-person offers a wider view of the battlefield), so it would make sense to make this an exclusive game mode.</p><p>Word first broke about a first-person camera in Fortnite way back in June 2022, with a leak showing off what appears to be a screenshot of a player enjoying Fortnite as an FPS. But between this initial leak and the renewed leaks around the launch of Chapter 4 Season 2, weâ€™ve heard almost nothing about a first-person mode in Fortnite. A few <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">minor leaks</a> have popped up, but thereâ€™s still no official word from Epic Games.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>FIRST PERSON CAMERA IN FORTNITE ðŸ”¥</p><p>This update Epic began working on some stuff about first person camera mode but there's no other info about it at the moment as it looks like it's still in early development. Would work REALLY well for the Zero Build Modes ðŸ‘€ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/PIRRmdLyp0</a></p>â€” HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href=#>June 7, 2022</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are the 'Fortnite' first-person leaks legit?</h2><p>While itâ€™s impossible to say with certainty if these leaks are real, itâ€™s obvious that Epic Games has no problems messing with its winning formula. Offering a Zero Build mode was a big move for the game â€“ and the same could be said of the inclusion of a first-person mode. And with so many high-profile names talking about these first-person leaks, it seems more likely than ever that a Fortnite first-person mode is just around the corner.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Epic Games</span></figure><p>Be sure to keep your eyes peeled as we move deeper into Chapter 4 Season 2, as thereâ€™s a good chance Epic Games will have some big announcements in the near future.
