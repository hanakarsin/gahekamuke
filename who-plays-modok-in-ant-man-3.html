The film is packed with familiar and fan-favorite characters, including returning players <a href=# style=text-align:start>Paul Rudd</a> as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, <a href=# style=text-align:start>Evangeline Lilly</a> as Hope Van Dyne/The Wasp, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne, and Michael Douglas as Hank Pym.</p><p>Since the release of the final full-length Ant-Man 3 trailer, Marvel aficionados have been excited about the villainous MODOK, who will appear in the film. <a href=#>Who plays MODOK</a>? Fans might be surprised to see a familiar face.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span><p>MODOK in the background of a scene from 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who plays MODOK in 'Ant-Man 3'?</h2><p>For the unfamiliar, MODOK is an acronym that stands for Mental/Mobile/Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing. The first iteration of the character, George Tarleton, is a former employee of A.I.M. who undergoes mutagenic experimentation to make himself smarter. The result is a gigantic head and a stunted body, which causes him to use a hover chair for mobility.</p><p>In Ant-Man 3, MODOK is played by actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Corey Stoll</a>, who fans of the Ant-Man series might recognize as Darren Cross/Yellowjacket from the first film. This callback might also be a nod to the power of Jonathan Majors's character <a href=#>Kang the Conqueror</a>, whose ability to bend the multiverse to his will could result in some interesting blends of past and the future.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span><p>Corey Stoll as Darren Cross/Yellowjacket in 'Ant-Man.'</p></figure><p>MODOK has already been introduced in part as the lead in the television show animated series M.O.D.O.K., where the character is voiced by <a href=#>Patton Oswalt</a>. However, the television series was not included as part of the MCU and canceled after one season. Rest assured, Ant-Man 3 likely won't be the last time Marvel uses the fan-favorite character.</p><p>Keep up with all the excitement in the MCU (and see what MODOK is up to) by going to see Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in theaters on Feb. 17, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwec%2BlmLKrXaK8pbvKZqCnZZGjwW65wKdkbA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
