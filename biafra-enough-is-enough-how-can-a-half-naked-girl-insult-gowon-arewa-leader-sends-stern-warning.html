Gowon only protected the country from disintegration. Gowon did not start the war against Nigeria. He only defended the unity of the country as Head of State which any patriotic leader would do.</p><p>“What has Gowon done that even in TikTok they are insulting him. The insult is too much. I saw a girl half naked insulting Gowon on TikTok. This should stop. Enough is enough.</p><p>“Why is it that Yakubu Gowon made a statement and he should be attacked. We have gone beyond where some of our Igbo brothers want to drag us to. We all should begin to focus on building our dear country Nigeria.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e49uZpuhkZu%2FonnEp6aun5hitrR5xKemrp%2BYYrWww4ycmKdlkWK1orjFZqWao5WZeqi10aVkoqajqrm1ecaorqimXZa%2FpsPAZqOemZSav26%2FxKebrGWjqbKzuoywmKummaO0cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
