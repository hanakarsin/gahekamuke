Each of them started their career early on and was introduced to the music industry at an early age. Together, Chris and Usher have more than 50 years of experience between them.</p><p>Each of the aforementioned R&B singers have a storied past, however, they’ve maintained the utmost respect for one another in the media.

In an April 2023 interview on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Boy’s Neighborhood</a>, Usher said that the feeling is mutual, even referring to the “Under the Influence” singer as his “little brother.”</p><p>"He’s always been there for me, and I’ve always been there with him. Through hard ups and down times, I’ve been there with him,” Usher told the host.</p><p>Although the two seem to have maintained a pretty close-knit relationship over the years, rumors of a rift between the two started circulating on social media in Spring 2023. So, <a href=#>do they have beef</a>?

Here’s what we know!</h2><p>"Is your man on the floor?" That’s the question everyone was asking after an alleged fight broke out between the R&B icons in May of 2023. News of an altercation first surfaced on May 6, the day after the incident reportedly went down.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Unlocked</a>, the two got into a squabble at Chris Brown’s 34th birthday party, which was hosted by Usher himself. However, things reportedly went left and ultimately got physical between Usher, Chris, and Chris’ security.</p><p>Despite rumors of a bloodied nose, Usher later posted a photo in which he looks pretty unbothered — and unscathed. Plus, Chris still performed at Usher’s "Lovers and Friends" festival in Vegas the following day, even further debunking the rumor that they fell out.</p><p>The two *seemingly* squashed both their beef — and the allegations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqsCpsdFmmKecXZi1s7XSZpmrp6ejeqe%2ByJ6lnauYnr0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
