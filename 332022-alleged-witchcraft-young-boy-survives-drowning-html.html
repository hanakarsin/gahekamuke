But Okon denied the accusation even as his aunt threatened to throw him into a river.</p><p>Ojedokun, who expressed shock, said the aunt on November 16, 2014, took the boy to the Imo River and threw him into the water with the expectation that Okon would drown to death.</p><p><i>“She actually threw Okon into Imo River thinking that the boy would drown. The boy came out of the water alive and went to their home, only to be told that her auntie had relocated,”</i> Ojedokun said.</p><p>Speaking also, Mr. Adeyemi Johnson, Project Director of the group further disclosed that HAPSTA/CRARN have reunited 16 children with their families from January to November, with two other children referred to the Ministry of Women Affairs.</p><p>Johnson said HAPSTA/CRARN had also rescued 17 children from January till date, while the organisation presently has 15 children in its centre.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>2015: Witches Declare Jonathan Winner</a></p><p><i>“We also organise advocacy town hall meetings in Okobo, Ebughu and Etinan, where child witches stigmatisation are commonplace.
