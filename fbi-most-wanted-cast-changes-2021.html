So what changed in the cast for 2021?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>It’s safe to say that 2021 has been a strange year for television between weird season timing and delayed filming schedules thanks to COVID-19. For one of CBS’s newer shows, <a href=#>FBI: Most Wanted</a>, its third season is bringing some changes. The cast for the high-intensity thriller is switching it up a bit, and while we’re disappointed in some changes, we’re excited about others.</p><p>This year brings a <a href=#>new season of FBI: Most Wanted</a>, and with it, new series regulars. So what exactly are the changes in the 2021 cast, and how will the third season be different from the past seasons?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Most cast members are returning to ‘FBI: Most Wanted’ in 2021.</h2><p>Although there are changes, we can definitely find comfort in the constant. So let’s go over what’s not changing first — several of our favorite cast members are returning in 2021.</p><p>Julian McMahon is coming back as Jess LaCroix, the leader of the Fugitive Task Force, and Roxy Sternberg is returning as Sheryll Barnes, the second in command. In addition, <a href=#>Keisha Castle Hughes</a> is back as the Intelligence Analyst Hana Gibson.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>But there’s one more returning cast member who’s getting promoted for Season 3. <a href=#>Miguel Gomez</a>, who plays Ivan Ortiz, is coming back as a series regular. He joined the FBI: Most Wanted cast in Season 2 as a recurring character, and we are very pleased that he’s now fully on the force.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But there are some cast members who aren't returning to ‘FBI: Most Wanted’ in 2021.</h2><p>Fans of FBI: Most Wanted went wild when <a href=#>Nathaniel Arcand</a>, who played Clinton Skye, slowly but surely disappeared from the show in Season 2. After missing a couple of episodes in Season 2, fans started to realize that he might not be back on the show at all.</p><p>And unfortunately, the rumors were correct. In a June Instagram post, Nathaniel wrote, “Moving On. Moving Forward. Don’t Look Back ... #clintonskye Must Say Bye. Bye,” confirming his exit from FBI: Most Wanted.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>But in a bigger shock, <a href=#>Kellan Lutz</a>, who played Special Agent Kenny "Ken" Crosby, will also not be returning to Season 3 of FBI: Most Wanted. At the end of Season 2, we hear gunshots but have no idea who gets hurt. In the Season 3 premiere, we learn that Ken is the one who got severely injured and needs to take a break from active duty.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kellan Lutz (@kellanlutz)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Kellan's been a central part of the show since day one and was even featured in FBI and FBI: International. However, after the COVID-19 pandemic and several losses in his own life, Kellan realized that his number one priority is to spend time with family.</p><p>He announced his exit in an Instagram post in which he shared some personal details about the losses he's been dealing with. But he also shared that he was very grateful to the cast and the team behind FBI: Most Wanted.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There’s another exciting cast change in 2021 for ‘FBI: Most Wanted.’</h2><p>Even though we’re losing a favorite, we’re gaining a new cast member who could be a new favorite! <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexa Davalos</a> is joining the cast of FBI: Most Wanted this year as a series regular, and we hope that she’ll be sticking around. She’s playing another agent joining LaCroix’s team, <a href=#>Kristin Gaines</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Before joining the cast of FBI: Most Wanted, Alexa played Juliana Crain in Amazon’s The Man in the High Castle, so fans might be familiar with her from that. She’s also been on our screens since 2002, with a small role in Judd Apatow’s Undeclared and a three-episode arc in Angel as Gwen Raiden.</p><p>She’s also well-known for playing Kyra in the 2004 film The Chronicles of Riddick. So while Alexa has been in tons of sci-fi projects, we can’t wait to see her in a new type of thriller.</p><p>FBI: Most Wanted airs on CBS Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm6%2Bqecyoqq1lp5a7tbHDZpqaq6RisKmtzaCcrGViZX9y</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
