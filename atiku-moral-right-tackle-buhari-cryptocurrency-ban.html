He should not wait to be made President of Nigeria before coming to the rescue of the jobless youths in Nigeria.</p><p>“Atiku is super rich, it’s incorrect to say that Atiku is a multi-billionaire, he is not, he is a trillionaire. He has the financial capacity and capability to minimize poverty in Nigeria.</p><p>“The truth is that Atiku has no moral right, to continue to attack Buhari on the issue of joblessness in the country, because Atiku is in position to help fight hunger, hardship and joblessness.</p><p>“He is not just a great politician but a technocrat of repute. Atiku has not done much to impress Nigerian youths that he will make a better President.</p><p>“Action they say speaks louder than voice. This is the best of time for him to tell Nigerian youths that he cares for them.</p><p>“Attacking Buhari is not the way out of joblessness, let him tell Nigerians his worth by coming with programs geared towards improving the welfare of the youths.</p><p>“We have had enough of his attacks on the government, let him cone out of his shell and help Nigerian youths.</p><p>“The money he has should not only be for his family members. It’s time for him to show gratitude for the privilege of ruling Nigeria for 8 years with Pa Obasanjo.</p><p>“Let him revive the Atiku Care Foundation. Waiting till election time to start showing kindness is deception.</p><p>“Let him leave Dubai and come over to Nigeria to rescue the youths from hunger and hardship. He has no excuse whatsoever for not doing this.</p><p>“President Buhari will be happy to see Atiku moving from one state to the other commissioning projects executed by him as a person.</p><p>“Attacking and faulting Buhari won’t put food on the table of the masses. If he can’t rise up to the occasion, let him stop faulting or attacking Buhari.</p><p>“He should leave that to the activists. I don’t expect Atiku to be an activist but a great philanthropist. The time to prove his worth is now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze49xZpqsmaDCbrnOq5ilZaKetKnAjK2YnKOcmnqjwceaqaJlk6fGscDOnKyrqpWjsLp5wZqlaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
