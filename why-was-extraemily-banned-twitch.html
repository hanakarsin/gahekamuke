However, at the time, she received a temporary ban on Oct. 13 due to a “violation of Twitch’s Community Guidelines and Terms of Service.” The ban came two days after her texting and driving incident, which fans assumed right away had to be the reason why the creator was banned.</p><p>“I have nothing against her personally,” said one Redditor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reacting</a> to the ban. “I really like her content but this was a necessary ban, not just for her but to show that Twitch is consistent with their rules enforcement. I hope that she learns from this experience.”</p><p>Another Reddit user corroborated this sentiment, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a>, “I’m a fan of her stream but this is simply deserving and I hope she actually takes this seriously and stops being reckless while driving.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>ExtraEmily using the phone while driving multiple times</a><br>by<a href=#>u/Toastylump</a> in<a href=#>LivestreamFail</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Reddit</a></figure><p>Officially, ExtraEmily hasn’t addressed the ban on social media, and she has yet to start a livestream since the day she was banned.
