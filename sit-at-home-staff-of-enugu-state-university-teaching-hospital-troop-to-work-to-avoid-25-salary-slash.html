And those who don’t come to work on Mondays will henceforth be surcharged 25 per cent of their salary.”</p><p>Also, it was observed that members of staff who lived far from the hospital reportedly stayed the night within the hospital premises to avoid any issues on Monday morning.</p><p>One of such member of staff said, “I had to come to the hospital yesterday (Sunday) to sleep over to comply with the new order because I would not be able to meet up if I try to come on Mondays.</p><p>“I live at Garrik on Agbani Road, and the government doesn’t provide vehicles on Monday for workers, and individual transport owners don’t bring out their vehicles very early in the morning for fear of being attacked.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BwZqyhpGKutXnHqKSeZaOprqeyjKidZp2eqrS2edKtmK2dXaq7qsLEq6qirKliwaatwqGgp59dnby0vMitmKVlpKe8sLyMraZmr5%2BnuG7AzmaYr6eZmXpzgYysmKWZoq56tLjArJ9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
