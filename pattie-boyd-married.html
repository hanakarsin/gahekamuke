She recalled their first meeting in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reader's Digest</a>, writing, "We were at the same party, and I found him very charming and handsome." Pattie noted that she and Rod kept in touch. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Telegraph</a> notes that they officially started dating in 1994, which was well after her marriage to Eric ended. (More on Pattie's marriage to Eric later.)</p><p>After more than two decades together, Pattie and Rod were married on April 29, 2015, at the Register Office in Chelsea Old Town Hall, London. They are still married today.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pattie was married to Beatles guitarist George Harrison for 11 years.</h2><p>In early 1964, Pattie was cast as a schoolgirl in the Beatles' musical comedy film A Hard Day's Night, where she met and quickly befriended the group's lead guitarist, George Harrison. He eventually asked her out on a date, but Pattie was in a relationship with photographer Eric Swayne; however, she ended things just a few days later and began dating George.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Pattie Boyd and George Harrison</p></figure><p>The two were wed on Jan. 21, 1966, in a ceremony at the Register Office in Epsom, England.</p><p>Pattie reflected on her time with George in Reader's Digest, stating that being with him was "wonderful." She added that they were "hanging out with the rest of the Beatles and we met all sorts of interesting people in the music business and we went to lots of clubs and restaurants."</p><p>Unfortunately, things weren't always sunshine and rainbows between Pattie and George.</p><p>She revealed to the outlet that while they were married, her modeling career suffered. Pattie also added that if she was working and George had nothing going on, he found it irritating.

Things were on the wane between me and George and I could no longer resist." After finalizing her divorce, Pattie started dating Eric; the two were later married on March 27, 1979.</p><p>Their marriage was doomed from the get-go, which led to Pattie drinking heavily. Eric later <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted</a> to abusing Pattie, stating that he raped her during their marriage and was a "full-blown" alcoholic. In 1987, Pattie left Eric and divorced him in 1989 on the grounds of infidelity and irrational behavior.</p><p>Pattie Boyd: My Life in Pictures is available for purchase in stores and online.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpa61wMieZJunqZl6rq3Rq6CenA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
