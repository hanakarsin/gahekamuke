But I call on the government to also include Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association, MACBAN and Fulani Nationality Movement, FUNAM in the category of terrorists because those bandits are their members,” Governor Ortom said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Nigeria’s Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Abubakar Malami (SAN), has said anyone who kidnaps innocent citizens for ransom is qualified as an insurgent.</strong></a></p><p>Malami, while speaking in an interview on Channels Television on Wednesday night, said apart from bandits, kidnappers can also be termed as terrorists following a recent court judgement.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that Malami was reacting to Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja declaration last week Thursday.</p><p>Taiwo had declared the activities of bandits in the country as acts of terrorism.&nbsp;The judge specifically declared Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta’adda bandit groups as terrorist groups following their nefarious activities in the North.</p><p>Speaking on the proscription of bandits, Malami noted that the court ruling had been gazetted and would soon be published as directed by the court.</p><p>The minister also disclosed that all the relevant security agencies had been notified of the court judgement.</p><p>He said, “It is in the process of being gazetted but the order has been procured and obtained. It is being gazetted and publication will come up very soon.</p><p>“If you kidnap using force, using arms, you are qualified as a terrorist within the dictates and determination and the judicial decision done by the court.
