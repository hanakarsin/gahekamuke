Somebody kickstarted it; somebody laid the foundation.</p><p>“Those claiming otherwise should also know that even in the biggest cities across the world, there are people who are not okay with the government.”</p><p>Dokubo said though the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Labour Party (LP), and the APC’s manifestoes are all great, the execution of the policies depends on their candidates.</p><p>He said despite the fact that Peter Obi and Rabiu Kwankwaso were former governors and have executive experience as Tinubu, the APC candidate is the best choice for the country in 2023.</p><p>The former militant, however, said former Vice President and PDP flagbearer, Atiku Abubakar, does not have such a credential as Tinubu</p><p>“Atiku has actually never actually handled executive power. He was a spare tire. He was a vice president,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5FuZmtoYmh6osDIpKxmqJWpsrN5zpugZqeknbKzv4ycmKemn6l6rq3TnJ9mrJmjwqPB0maYnKCZmsOmucSnq6xlkaius7WMnaakrZKkfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
