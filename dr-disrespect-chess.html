In his statement, he told fans that he would be taking an "extended vacation" with his family, but would not be leaving content creation altogether: "They want me to disappear... yeah f--king right."</p><p>And now, it seems that he plans to make good on that promise. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a cryptic X post</a> made on July 31, Dr Disrespect shared a photo of himself playing chess with someone who seems to be playing checkers — and the internet has plenty to say.</p><p>What's going on?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Dr Disrespect's chess post has drawn a lot of questioning.</h2><p>It's the old adage: You're playing checkers while I'm playing chess. It's meant to mean that the chess player is always one step ahead, or that they're playing a bigger, more complex game. That seems to be the intent behind Dr Disrespect's post, though with no caption, he's made no indication of who he's referring to as the checkers player.</p><p>Is it Twitch? Not likely, as he's been permanently banned from the platform — and with an outright admission of his wrongdoing, it's unlikely that they'll reinstate him any time soon, and he'll probably continue to distance himself from the company going forward.</p><p>Maybe he's talking about his haters? That's what some fans seem to think, at least on social media. In response to his post, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one X user</a> wrote, "Still No. 1, champ. Don’t worry about these weirdos."</p><p>However, it's all speculation at this point.</p><p>Until Dr Disrespect provides a little more information — which we're sure he'll do soon — it's pretty unclear who he's trying to reference. However, in the absence of context, plenty of jokes are being made at the streamer's expense.</p><p>"Is this you playing with a minor?" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one person</a> said, to which Doc oh so creatively replied, "Good one she/her."</p><p>Another X user wrote, "I’m surprised you’re playing, considering there [are] over 18 pieces on that board."
