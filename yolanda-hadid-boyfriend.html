The two live a perfect life together 10 miles away from each other (which is the way to go, TBH). They ride horses together and live, what seems to be an idyllic life on a farm. According to Yolanda, they are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>“very much in love.”</u></a></p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Yolanda Hadid’s boyfriend, anyhow?</h2><p>Joseph Jingoli, who Yolanda has been seeing for about 16 months now, is an investor, CEO of a few companies (including a construction company called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Joseph Jingoli & Son, Inc</u></a>), and the president of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Farm Team</u></a>, a nonprofit which helps young adults recover from their addictions. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to an insider</a>, per E!

The calm in the middle of my storm and the rock in this most difficult time...
