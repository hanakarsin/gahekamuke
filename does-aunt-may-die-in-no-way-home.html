If you are not ok with that, we recommend you stop reading.</strong></p><p>After the long-awaited <a href=#>second trailer</a> for Spider-Man: No Way Home made the rounds on social media, many eagle-eyed viewers believed Marvel Studios might have spoiled the tragic death of Peter's beloved Aunt May. Sadly, it's true ‚Äî Maria Tomei's Aunt May tragically perishes in No Way Home.</p><p>Once Peter takes the villains to Happy Hogan's (Jon Favreau) apartment, he successfully cures <a href=#>Doc Ock</a> (Alfred Molina) by replacing his broken inhibitor chip with Stark Industries technology.</p><p>However, before he can save the others, the <a href=#>Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe)</a> persona takes over Norman Osborn. As a result, the rest of the villains escape as Peter and the Green Goblin partake in a violent and terrifying fight.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>66 year old Willem Dafoe only agreed to return as the Green Goblin as long as he was allowed to perform the stunts and fight scenes.

With his famous pumpkin bombs back in play, Green Goblin causes some severe damage against Spider-Man and his close circle.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Green Goblin kills Aunt May in 'No Way Home.'</h2><p>Unfortunately, Aunt May tragically dies at the hands of Green Goblin. As Peter and Green Goblin fight on the ground floor of the apartment building, Aunt May arrives to help Peter. Goblin sees this, and in a matter of seconds, he chucks a pumpkin bomb in May's direction.</p><p>Peter dives to catch it, and the bomb explodes. It appears both he and May survive the blow, and she tells Peter she is OK. Sadly, she doesn't make it out alive.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The parallel of the deaths of aunt may and uncle bens leaving the same phrases "With great power comes great responsibility", leads to a character development of Peter Parker.

She urges her nephew to remain empathetic, even for his most destructive and hostile enemies. "With great power, there must come great responsibility," she says weakly before collapsing to the ground.</p><p>The scene is utterly heartbreaking, one that strongly influences Peter's character arc in the rest of the film. He goes on the cure the rest of the No Way Home supervillains in May's honor and bonds with his fellow Spider-Men over their losses of Uncle Ben and Gwen Stacy.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Aunt May dies in ‚ÄúSpider-Man: No Way Home‚Äù and also she says ‚Äúwith great power comes great responsibility.‚Äù</p>‚Äî üíªüñ§ (@blowuphelicopt) <a href=#>December 14, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>May's death also cements her role as the figure who teaches Tom Holland's Peter Parker about the responsibilities he must carry as a superhero and the sacrifices he needs to make to continue being the web-slinging vigilante. Thus, Aunt May fills in for the role of Uncle Ben.</p><p>We're sad to see her go, but her death provides Peter Parker with his official Spider-Man origin story. Her death hit harder than any other of Peter's role models, but without her dying or delivering that famous phrase, Peter would never reach his full Spider-Man potential. Now, Peter is ready to start fresh and embrace a more mature side of his superhero persona.</p><p>Spider-Man: No Way Home is now playing exclusively in theaters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4yarKesXaKuunnDopxmoZ5iu7B51pqwZqCforI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
