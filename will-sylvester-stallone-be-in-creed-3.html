Jordan, who was also the director of the movie.</p><p>"That’s a regretful situation because I know what it could have been,” Sylvester <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">told the Hollywood Reporter</a>. "It was taken in a direction that is quite different than I would’ve taken it... I wish them well, but I’m much more of a sentimentalist. I like my heroes getting beat up, but I just don’t want them going into that dark space. I just feel people have enough darkness."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Wait, doesn't Sylvester Stallone own the rights to 'Rocky'?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Stallone at the Golden Globes with the award for best supporting actor in 'Creed'.</p></figure><p>Surprisingly, Sylvester does not own the rights to the franchise, despite writing the original Rocky movie, which won Best Picture and Best Screenplay at the 1977 Academy Awards.</p><p>In an interview he had with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Sylvester revealed he felt robbed of his ownership stake in the multi-million dollar franchise.</p><p>"I have zero ownership of Rocky,” he said. "Every word, every syllable, every grammatical error was all my fault. It was shocking that it never came to be, but I was told, 'Hey, you got paid, so what are you complaining about?’ I was furious."</p><p>He went on to blame his lack of "business savvy" at the time.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sylvester Stallone called out Dolph Lundgren for his reported 'Drago' spinoff.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Sylvester also got into spat a spat with Rocky IV star Dolph Lundgren over an Ivan Drago spin-off series, accusing his former co-star of going behind his back with producer Irwin Winkler.</p><p>"Throughout history so many artists in every industry, recording, painting, writing, you name it have been destroyed by these bloodsuckers who have destroyed so many families, lining their pockets with other people's work..." Sylvester wrote in a since-deleted Instagram post.</p><p>He also called out Dolph, writing (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET</a>), "By the way, I once had nothing but respect for Dolph but he NEVER told me about what was going on behind my back with the character I created for him !!!

There's no approved script, no deals in place, no director, and I was personally under the impression that my friend Sly Stallone was involved as a producer or even as an actor," he wrote. "There was a press leak last week which was unfortunate. In touch with Mr. Balboa — just so all the fans can relax…. There ya go."</p><p>Now, fans can only hope Rocky aka Sylvester Stallone will make his grand return for Creed IV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLatuIyssKWulajBpr6MrKuapJyku6Z5wZ5koqZdmL%2BmscNmag%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
