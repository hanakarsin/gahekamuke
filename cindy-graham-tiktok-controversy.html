You and your mom have to stop at the grocery store to pick up some Gushers for your lunches. You run into your teacher and are so embarrassed because it's weird that your teacher is in the wild and leaves their classroom at all.</p><p>We're sure this is a scenario that has played out for the majority of us. And with social media, it's even worse.</p><p>Like, being a <a href=#>teacher on TikTok</a> is a real thing. There are <a href=#>teachers</a> that make fun of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the ridiculous things</a> they have to endure, there are theater teachers who have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gone viral for the way they announce their next musical</a>, and then we have the teachers who share <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tips and tricks for other teachers</a>.</p><p>But no matter how viral they get, it's always a little bit awkward for a student to see their <a href=#>teacher on the platform</a>. Especially if that teacher is Cindy Graham. Her <a href=#>TikToks</a> have created quite the controversy.

Her TikTok bio reads, "Breaking teacher norms on my IG."</p><p>At first, Cindy's TikToks just seem unprofessional. The one above reads, "When he has a dad bod and flirts with me, while picking up his kid from school" and the sound paired with it is, "Me? Obsessed with you? Yes, yes I am, b---h."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@cindyggraham href=#>@cindyggraham</a><p>Would you be thinking the same??üòÖ</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Big Body" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Big Body</a></figure><p>In this video, Cindy plays the "father" of one of her students, who mouths, "Oh yeah, hun get your tits out" after Cindy spills water on her shirt at school.</p><p>While definitely inappropriate, those are some of the tamer videos.

In the video, she says, "She's just playing on the fact that a lot of people want to do stuff to their teachers... Their [teachers'] rules for what they can post online are so strict."</p><p>Even further proof that Cindy is most likely playing on the "hot for teacher" idea is that we found her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">OnlyFans</a> account, which is centered around that same theme.</p><p>And if Cindy is, in fact, a teacher... she has definitely been fired by now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLavsNhmnquZmJa6bsDIpKuoo12YvK%2FA0aitnqqjrg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
