In an interview with Punch, Katagum said that the reason he left the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was because the principles for which he joined the party in 2014 were no longer valid.
He argued that he joined the party because of ideals such as fairness and justice and they (north) had expected Buhari to be like Mahatmah Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. <a href=../../../../north-thought-buhari-would-be-the-next-mahatma-gandhi-bauchi-ex-deputy-governor.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../../2023-buhari-had-a-preferred-candidate-but-didnt-influence-the-outcome-of-apc-primaries-presidency.html>2023: Buhari Had A Preferred Candidate But Didn't Influence The Outcome Of APC Primaries</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

The special adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina made this known in an opinion statement released on Thursday night titled ‘Knock, Knock! Who’s There?’.
