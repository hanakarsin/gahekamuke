He can come again. I told him he shouldn‚Äôt leave boxing. He‚Äôs two fights in, and he‚Äôs fought the best.</p><p>‚ÄúHe can go a long way if he stays dedicated.‚Äù</p><p><strong>Watch as Anthony Joshua knocked out Francis Ngannou below:</strong></p><p>The fact that Anthony Joshua knocked down Francis Ngannou three times in two rounds, AJ joked with reporters that he should have been given the WBC title that Fury held when Ngannou knocked the British down once in 2023.</p><p>The 34-year-old Nigerian-born boxer said, ‚ÄúFrancis Ngannou beat the WBC heavyweight champion of the world ‚Äì I should be the WBC heavyweight champion of the world. He‚Äôs a dreamer, a risk-taker, that story of his should not be clouded by tonight.‚Äù</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-832572 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_20240309-055306.jpg alt="Anthony Joshua knocked out Francis Ngannou" width=598 height=410 sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-832572 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Anthony Joshua knocked out Francis Ngannou.</strong></p><p>The 37-year-old Francis Ngannou, who was iconic in mixed martial arts before he ventured into heavyweight boxing, where he suffered two defeats in two bouts against two of the best in the game, has apologized to his fans for his abysmal performance against Anthony Joshua.</p><p>After suffering three knockdowns in two rounds, Ngannou took to his X page to write: ‚ÄúSorry guys, I let you all down üòî Today was a bad day in the office, but tomorrow will be another day. Thank you all for the love ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù</p><p>With the domineering win over Francis Ngannou, AJ has now recorded 28 wins and just three defeats in his boxing career.</p><p>The eyes of his boxing promoter, Eddie Hearn, are now fixated on Joshua taking on the winner of Tyson Fury vs Oleksandr Usyk unified heavyweight bout, which will take place on May 18.</p><p>After Joshua knocked out Ngannou months after knocking out Otto Wallin who had given Fury a tough time in the past, Eddie Hearn declared that AJ can face any heavyweight boxer in the world.</p><p>‚Äú(Fury) struggled against Otto Wallin. AJ destroyed him, it was a mismatch,‚Äù Hearn told MMA Junkie. ‚ÄúHe struggled against Francis Ngannou. AJ destroyed him, it was a mismatch. It‚Äôs not necessarily about comparing the two, but it‚Äôs nice.‚Äù</p><p>He added, ‚ÄúHe can beat a lot of heavyweights, just not Anthony Joshua. Maybe he can beat Tyson Fury, but you can‚Äôt get knocked out like that too often. And that‚Äôs just a stark reminder of the difference between elite-level boxing and MMA.‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e49yZpqmpJ28r8WMo6asoKWWeq%2BzwKelqK1dnbKivs1mqZ6Zk6l6orLTnqlmmZqoeqy6zpyiqK2kYsSquoywmK2bmGK4sHnVopuep18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
