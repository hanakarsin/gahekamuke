After 12 years together, five of which were spent married, Katie waved goodbye, citing "irreconcilable differences" as the culprit.</p><p>Ever since their split, these exes have plunged back into the dating scene. And guess what? They've got their eyes on the same catch: <a href=#>Scheana Shay</a>'s buddy, Tori Keeth. Yes, you read that right — these former lovebirds are vying for the affection of the very same person!</p><p>So, what's the scoop? Are both Katie and Schwartz dating Tori? Let's dive into the juicy deets below!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">So, are 'Vanderpump Rules' stars Katie and Schwartz both dating Tori?!</h2><p>Alright, buckle up because here's the scoop: Katie and Schwartz are both turning on the charm with Tori. And if you've got a good memory, you might recall that they each steal a kiss from the singer in the Season 11 trailer.</p><p>Fast forward to a preview for the April 9 episode, and Scheana spills the tea. Despite her shaky matchmaking history, she takes credit for playing Cupid and introducing Schwartz to Tori. Cue a flashback where Tori lays it on him, saying, "Just so you know, I think you're hot."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>Back then, Scheana thinks there wouldn't be any hiccups setting Schwartz up with Tori, believing Katie is "totally over" Schwartz. Well, as it turns out, Scheana missed the mark big time because Katie's got eyes for Tori too!</p><p>So, Scheana decides to play matchmaker once more and introduces Katie to Tori. In a flashback, we see the two hit it off, with Tori complimenting Katie's hair with an enthusiastic, "I f--king love your hair." And when Katie catches wind of Scheana setting Tori up with Schwartz, she allegedly boldly suggests, "No, Tori should date me instead."</p><p>With Scheana setting the stage for how Schwartz and Katie cross paths with Tori, the sneak peek shifts to the group's beach day. Schwartz wastes no time approaching Tori for a chat. Later, he discusses their connection in a confessional, admitting, "I always thought Tori was, like, super cute ... [and] she confessed to me she thinks I'm pretty fly as well."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tori Keeth (@torikeeth)</a></p></figure><p>Eventually, Schwartz and Tori agree to go on an official date — but just as they're about to pop the champagne, Katie makes her grand entrance and puts a stop to their celebration.</p><p>"Where did you come from?" Schwartz asks, playfully calling his ex-wife a "little c--k blocker" in a confessional. He's a bit puzzled, wondering if Katie's really into Tori or if she's just trying to one-up him.</p><p>Katie's retort? "If he doesn't like me taking his girls from him, maybe he should try harder." Oh, the drama!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Katie and Schwartz said their love triangle with Tori is "a weird thing."</h2><p>In January 2024, the Vanderpump Rules co-stars spilled the beans to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, shedding light on their unexpected love triangle with Tori.</p><p>"How did it come to this? I'm convinced there was some sort of magnetic pull or shift, and I'm in a parallel universe now," Schwartz shared with the outlet at the Season 11 premiere. "For better or for worse, I don't know yet."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Katie was equally perplexed, telling Us Weekly, "I didn't plan it because I didn't know that they had been chatting or talking or there was a thing happening when I had been like, 'Oh, hey.'"</p><p>"I was like, what am I gonna do, just be like, 'Oh, why don't you guys just [go ahead]?'" she continued. "I'm like, 'No, I like her too, so I'm going to hang out with her too. And whoever she likes more, I guess she'll just [decide].'"</p><p>Reflecting on the strange twist of events, Katie added, "It was just a weird thing. Some people thought I was maybe gonna go after her just because of Tom. I was like, 'I don't wake up in the morning and plan my day around what this man is doing,' so I just had already decided what I decided, and I wasn't gonna let that stop me."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Tori Keeth is a Los Angeles-based actress and singer.</h2><p>OK, let's take a moment to acquaint ourselves with Tori Keeth!

Scheana emphasizes Tori's reliability, disclosing, "Tori is someone I've known since she was, like, 16 years old. She's someone who has spent time with [my daughter] Summer before, and she is someone I absolutely trust."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>Given Tori's experience as a nanny, Scheana asks Tori to lend a helping hand to her mom, Erika, who could use a bit of assistance in caring for Scheana's two-year-old daughter, Summer.</p><p>As expected, Tori graciously accepts the role! Erika then highlights Tori's significance in Scheana's life, stating, "I think, too, your friendship with her has helped so much because you get her."</p><p style=text-align:left>Catch new episodes of Vanderpump Rules on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.
