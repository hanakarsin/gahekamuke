They wrote their report which state that I was only speculating and that there was no evidence. But now there is evidence.</p><p>“The whole country now is being overrun and one very clear thing that is happening now is that these foreign invaders are destroying everything and our government allowed them to come into the country.</p><p>“As a soldier, my training teaches me that the best defence attacks. Right now we are all sitting ducks and these people are armed to the teeth with weapons of mass destruction.</p><h2>The Plan Of The Bandits</h2><p>According to Danjuma, the plan of the bandits is to re-colonize Nigeria and take over the large expanse of land.</p><p>He however added that Nigeria must rise up to the occasion, confront and chase the criminals away as anything short of that is dangerous for the country.</p><p>He said:&nbsp;“They are trying to recolonise us and take over our land. This country with the largest population of black men is being brought to ruin by absolutely useless criminals.</p><p>“My prayer is that God Almighty that has given us this land would give us the courage to face up to our enemies, locate where they are and root them out; driving them out of the country otherwise Nigeria is finished.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FsZqCnppq%2Fr7nEp6tmmZyhvLixw2aZmqaUnsG0ecinq6hlnp60pr7ImmStoJWueritza1kraddp7Jur86lpqehqpp6tr%2BMrbBmnJGjt7a5wGapmqGjmsBustGeqqFlkaGus7mO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
