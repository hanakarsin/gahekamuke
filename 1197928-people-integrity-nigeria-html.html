He explained that:</p>It is unfortunate that nobody is teaching about these good and distinguished people (disciplined character, integrity, and honesty) today as a result of poor curriculum even in history. What we have mostly in history curriculum is political and economic history. Emphasis on social history or biographical studies which would have to a large extent taught the new generation about a few of these noble men is missing. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/f62cc0c2d7c28395.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Blaming Buhari over current hardship disrespectful to Nigerians, says APC chieftain</span></p></a>Many people now stand on the mandates of men and women of questionable character. Materialism and quest for power has taken over our sense of reasoning and judgements. Today, parents now ask their children to do internet scam (Yahoo Yahoo) and all sort of cries. The Yoruba proverb "Omo eni ko se agbafo, o n ko aso wa le" meaning "a child who is not into laundry business now brings clothes home is thrown to the winds".<p class=align-left>In a nutshell, he said that no leader today is worth imitating ethically or morally. These two basic virtues which are the foundation and fabric of any just society have been bastardised and we all can see the consequences all over the country. Despite the number of religious gatherings and annual crusades and conventions as well as the religiosity of/in schools; social vices keep increasing.</p>The leaders who would have shaped the society through their deeds are not worthy and sometimes even influence the young ones negatively. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/b40b21536a4edb1a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Peter Obi reacts as Tinubu’s govt sponsors 1,411 delegates to COP28: “We must stop waste”</span></p></a><h2>What is the meaning of people of integrity?</h2><p class=align-left>A person with integrity demonstrates a moral commitment to their principles and ideas.
