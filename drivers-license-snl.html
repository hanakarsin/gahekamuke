Just me play my song first.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Will Heath/NBC</span></figure><p>But as the track plays, the guys forget all about the billiards. They still keep up their machismo, though, trying not to let on how much the song affects them. “It’s about a girl getting her driver’s license, but it’s bittersweet because it’s something she and her ex always talked about it,” Beck says, before trying to save face. “That’s what I guessed based on hearing it for the first time right now.”</p><p>Alex responds: “Yeah, sure, sure, sure, if you wanna get all literal, but I think I overheard on the news or something that it’s actually about the kids from High School Musical? I don’t know.”</p><p>“High School Musical: The Series,” Regé-Jean clarifies. “<a href=#>Olivia wrote about Joshua Bassett</a> who’s allegedly now with Sabrina Carpenter.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">”Why is this hitting me so hard?”</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: SNL/YouTube</span></figure><p>And it isn’t long before the guys are getting emotional over the song lyrics. “It’s like she ripped a page out of my diary,” Beck says. “I mean, notebook! I mean, plain brown leather – I can’t read or write!”</p><p>And then Kate, in character as an elderly man with wild gray hair and an impressive mustache, says, “I got my driver’s license 55 years ago. Why is this hitting me so hard?”</p><p>Finally, the guys stop with the pretenses and rave about the music, debating whether Olivia is the next Taylor Swift or the next Billie Eilish and observing how pain can be “creatively generative.” (“Yeah, like, remember when I lost 50 g’s on the Giants?” Kenan says. “That gave me, like, half my poems.”)</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: GIPHY</span></figure><p>But Kate’s character asks them to shut up, open their hearts, and listen. “We’re about to get the bridge of our lives,” she says. And then the guys launch into a group singalong.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The sketch riffs on the public’s fixation on the song’s lyrics.</h2><p>As Regé-Jean explained to his characters’ bros on SNL, “Drivers License” is indeed speculated to be about Olivia’s relationship and breakup with Joshua Bassett — one of her costars on the Disney+ series High School Musical: The Musical: The Series — and his reported relationship with fellow Disney star <a href=#><u>Sabrina Carpenter</u></a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: GIPHY</span></figure><p>But Olivia downplayed the rumored drama in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a</u> <u>Billboard</u> <u>interview in January</u></a>, saying, “I totally understand people’s curiosity with the specifics of who the song’s about and what it’s about, but to me, that’s really the least important part of the song. It’s resonating with people because of how emotional it is, and I think everything else is not important.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmb%2BqwsSrqmakmZiyr7%2FEZqqnpA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
