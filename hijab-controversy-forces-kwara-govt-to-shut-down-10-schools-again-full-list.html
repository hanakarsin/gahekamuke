Anthony College, Offa Road, ECWA School, Oja Iya, Surulere Baptist Secondary School, Bishop Smith Secondary School, Agba Dam, CAC Secondary School Asa Dam road, St. Barnabas Secondary School Sabo Oke, St. John School Maraba, St. Williams Secondary School Taiwo Isale, and St. James Secondary School Maraba.</p><p>The government statement on the matter as made available to <strong>Naija News</strong> reads: “The Ministry of Education and Human Capital Development wishes to inform members of the public that the 10 government schools where the use of hijaab is disputed will remain shut until a later date.”</p><p>“This decision has been taken for safety reasons.”</p><p>“The government, therefore, directs schoolchildren and teachers in the affected schools to remain at home until the contrary is announced. The government remains committed to fairness, pluralism, and respect for the law and rights of every citizen at all times.”</p><p>It will be recalled the schools had <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>earlier been shut down in the wake of the controversy</a></strong> but were ordered to be re-opened on Monday, 8th March before a counter-directive was now issued by the government on the matter.</p><p>In other news, the Oluwo of Iwo, <strong>Oba Abdulrasheed Akanbi</strong>, on Sunday, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>called on Fulani herdsmen to live in the towns</a></strong> rather than reside inside the bushes so that everyone will know them.</p><p>The monarch also called on Fulani residents in towns to fish out the criminals among them in the interest of peaceful co-existence.</p><p>Oba Akanbi in a statement posted on his Facebook page, on Sunday, alleged that all security issues in the South-West are about the 2023 presidential election.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH10e49xZqGhmpavbq%2FOp6urp6aav7TFjJ%2Bmq5uVqHqsw8CrmGafn6vBbsDOZqqhraRisbDDzWZoaWWjmLWwu8usZJqfkZ67brLUpaNmpJmowXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
