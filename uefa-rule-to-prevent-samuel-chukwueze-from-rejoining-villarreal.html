The club is working on market possibilities, with both positions being priorities for Marcelino. In the case of the right winger, one of the possibilities could have been the return of the Nigerian Samuel Chukwueze, since he knows the house perfectly, adding that it would be an immediate performance reinforcement.</p><p>“But that possibility has been ruled out from the first moment since the player cannot return on loan to the team he left before his contract expired. It should be remembered that Villarreal transferred Chukwueze this summer to Milan for around €28m, leaving the player with one more year on his contract. For this reason, UEFA considers that the winger has two federative licenses this season: that of Milan and that of Villarreal.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5FwZq6dlpZ6s8HLnmStp12lv6bCxKerZquRosKmuIycn66jp6qyu7GMn6mopV2nsqu7yKegp59dq7atuMCrqZ6ZnGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
