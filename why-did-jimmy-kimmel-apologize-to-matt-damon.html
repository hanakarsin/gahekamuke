The answer dates back to 2005. Here's a look at the stars' two-decade feud.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Hollywood's most famous feuds include beef between <a href=#>Taylor Swift and Kanye West,</a> <a href=#>Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall</a>, and <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> and Hailey Bieber. <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel</a> and <a href=#>Matt Damon</a> are also on that infamous list.</p><p>Of course, as fans well know, the late night host and A-list actor are <a href=#>actually close friends</a>. Their feud, which began in 2005, is all in good fun. But many people are wondering how the fictional feud even began.</p><p>The hilarious quarrel kicked off with an apology. Here's what we know about the genesis of a fight we hope doesn't end soon, truth be told.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Jimmy Kimmel apologize to Matt Damon in the first place?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>During the <a href=#>2023 Oscars</a>, Jimmy found time to poke the bear, er, Matt Damon, by joking about his imaginary enemy. During a bit, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">host asked</a> <a href=#>Jessica Chastain</a>, who was seated in the audience at the Dolby Theater, “Was it difficult filming your movie The Martian because your co-star Matt Damon can’t read and smells like dog medicine?”</p><p>Jessica played off the question like a pro, saying she didn't have many scenes with Matt so all was good. But as home viewers laughed along, we couldn't help but wonder why the two stars are always riding one another in the first place.</p><p>The feud goes back to 2005, when Jimmy cracked a joke about how Matt wouldn't get cut for time on his late night show, because he's such a big star. “I want to apologize to Matt Damon, we ran out of time," was a joke he went on to share at the end of his program on an ongoing basis.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Matt Damon has gotten Jimmy Kimmel back plenty of times.</h2><p>Although Jimmy's apology to Matt started their pretend feud, the Good Will Hunting star has enjoyed playing along over the years. Memorably, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrated Jimmy's loss</a> at the Emmys on stage — when his arch nemesis was hosting the event.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The actor has also engaged in some NSFW digs at Jimmy, with one notable instance being a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">music video</a> he and the host's then-girlfriend <a href=#>Sarah Silverman</a> performed about their so-not-real intimate relationship.</p><p>Not to be outdone, Jimmy countered Matt's video with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his own</a> that featured his and the Oscar winner's <a href=#>BFF Ben Affleck</a>. Again, all of this in good fun — even if some of the material hasn't aged particularly well.</p><p>In any event, remember fans: The entire feud started with a joking apology about Matt's appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live being cut for time. And there you have it!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aimaK6unnKoqSmnZxirrG7y6ieorKVYsGwecyaq61llJa6sLo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
