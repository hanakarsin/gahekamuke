Here's who Ellis is, and what he does. A big congrats to the newly engaged couple!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>One day ago, Amy Johnson <a href=#>from Below Deck</a> announced on Instagram that she <a href=#>was engaged</a>. On July 3, she wrote, “It all feels like a dream. Easiest “YES” of all time!!! I can not wait to be your MRS!!!” The photo shows Amy and her now-fiancé celebrating on the beach with friends and family.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who’s Amy Johnson’s fiancé?</h2><p>Below Deck’s Amy is engaged to Ellis Lenthall, who, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to his LinkedIn</a>, is an “Experienced Industrial Outside Sales Account Executive.” He currently works at Jo-Kell Inc in Virginia (and has been with the company for over seven years). The engagement announcement only comes a few months after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy told Bravo’s The Daily Dish</a> about the relationship, saying, “I have so many great words to say about him, but I’m not going to gush too much. He’s amazing.” This was during the time she appeared on the Below Deck 100th anniversary celebration in New York.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>So amazing that she decided to marry him! Not much else is known about Ellis, and the couple has been pretty discreet about their relationship online. We do know that the couple was definitely dating in October, 2019 (Ellis posted a photo of them on his Instagram, captioning it, “In a place filled with dollars, I found a dime.” But for how long exactly is unclear.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>We also know that Ellis has a sister and is an uncle to a baby girl. Here’s Ellis with his niece. (It’s possible his sister has more children and that he may have more siblings, but he keeps things fairly private on Instagram!).&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>And here’s a photo of himself with his sister on her birthday in 2018. “Happy Birthday @saralgreene! Your balance of hard work ethic and attention to detail all while being a great wife and mother will always inspire me! #birthday #sisterlove.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>He also, apparently loves his wine. (He’s got a handful more Instagram photos that are just bottles of wine, mainly red.)&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Amy isn’t the only Below Deck star to get engaged or married recently. Amy and Connie Arias went on double dates when they were in town. Plus, we all saw Parker McCown’s epic underwater proposal on Below Deck Sailing Yacht as well as freshly engaged Joao Franco from Below Deck Med. Tiffany Copeland from Below Deck Med found a photo of her engagement ring which inspired her boyfriend to propose to her as well. Bryan Kattenburg from Below Deck Med also got engaged, along with Julia d’Albert Pusey from Below Deck Med and Adrienne Gang from Below Deck.&nbsp;</p><p>There must be something pretty romantic about yachts and traveling the seas. Congrats, Amy, and congrats everyone!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJqlqWK3sLTNrKanq12btqK6wp4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
