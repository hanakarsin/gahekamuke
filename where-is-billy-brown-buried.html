He was 68 years old. Since then, fans have watched the cast mourn his death and try their best to move forward. They want to know where he's buried, especially since the Brown family has moved around a bunch because of some family members' serious health concerns.</p><p>Now that the show has entered its 13th season, fans are also curious what this means for Alaskan Bush People. How will the family come together after such a huge loss, especially since this happened so recently after the <a href=#>wildfire that tore through their Washington home</a>? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Discovery</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Where is Billy Brown buried?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, Billy was cremated, and a service was held for him at Bergh Funeral Service in Oroville, Wash. on Feb. 22, 2021. But it's unclear what the family has done with the ashes since then. Some people choose to keep them in their homes. But there are other options, including placing them in a cemetery or scattering them.</p><p>Billy lived life on his own terms until the very end. He had health issues for a while before his death, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a> reports that he didn't follow his doctor's orders. They told him that living in the mountains wasn't a good call because the high altitude made it harder for him to breathe.</p><p>But it turns out that Billy's breathing trouble was due to a larger issue with his heart. Ami, Billy's widow, eventually had the tough task of telling their children that their father was not going to get better.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The 13th season of 'Alaskan Bush People' is dedicated to Billy.</h2><p>Even though Billy is no longer with us, the show must go on, and on Sept. 19, 2021, the 13th season of Alaskan Bush People premiered. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a post by Discovery</a>, the whole season has been dedicated to the family's patriarch. "He was a trailblazer, and the family will strive to keep his dreams and sense of adventure alive for generations to come," the post said.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>“We were founded on faith, freedom, and family.”</p><p>Billy forges a new path for his family on the season premiere of <a href=#>#AlaskanBushPeople</a> tomorrow at 8p on <a href=#>@Discovery</a> and <a href=#>@discoveryplus</a>. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/oKKtGgBXBp</a></p>— Alaskan Bush People (@AlaskanBushPPL) <a href=#>September 18, 2021</a></figure><p>So far, fans of Alaskan Bush People are loving the latest season. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One person</a> wrote on Twitter, "They could survive anything." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Someone else</a> wrote that they're obsessed with the show and that it makes them want to "buy some land and disappear."</p><p>One interesting thing about the new season will be how Ami deals with all of this going forward. She's had her own health issues over the years, and it would make sense that her family is scared of losing her too.</p><p>Back in 2017, <a href=#>Ami was diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer</a>. The family moved from Alaska to Washington at that time in order to be closer to her doctors. Luckily, the family got the news that same year that her cancer was in remission.</p><p>You can watch Alaskan Bush People on Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on the Discovery Channel and on Discovery Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlkp65rcWMm6mor55ir7a%2ByJ6b</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
