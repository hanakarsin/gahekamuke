The reason I withdrew was very simple. I complained about the process to the team that was sent from Abuja to conduct the primaries for the governorship, and senate. I spoke with them and it seems they went to Bauchi with a predetermined mind.</p><p>“The party leadership and the gentleman who is assigned the responsibility of leading APC in Bauchi State, the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, I had a conversation with him on how things could go amicably and APC would not lose. But since those suggestions were not adhered to, as a result, two of my colleagues just jumped ship.</p><p>“I feel very sad because of my role in establishing APC itself in Bauchi. I feel things did not go right.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5FyZrCgqWK2brDInWSnp6RitKbAjJqnnGWimsG2vs1mq6Kbm5rBbq7UpaKam5iqxKJ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
