Let’s take a look at some of them and their genuine meaning.</p><ul><li>The Ọjị tradition</li></ul><p class=align-left>This is an ancient Igbo custom connected with bitter kola nuts. These nuts are valued not for their delicious flavor (they hardly have any). They are a valuable part of social interactions. These nuts are normally shared with friends as a sign of the friendship. They are also offered to guests as a treat and gratitude for their arrival.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3fhjtj5p33a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Everything you didn't not know about the amazing Tiv culture</span></p></a><p class=align-left>During the Ọjị ceremony, the oldest of the present persons completes the so-called ịgọ ọfọ. This is a kind of blessing to the kola that has provided the nuts, the ancestors, and the luck of all the present ones. Then, the nut is split into parts and distributed among the party.</p><ul><li>The Ọmụ nkwụ custom</li></ul><p class=align-left>This one is connected to palm tree shoots, which are considered sacred. Palm tree shoots have the power to remove the evil or the trace of evil deeds. It can be used to show and prove that something is sacred and valued. At ancient times, when some settlements were at war with each other people who needed to enter the enemy area held a palm tree shoot to prove that they don’t plan any evil.</p><ul><li>The custom of markings</li></ul><p class=align-left>Igbo people have several common types of markings they apply to their bodies and faces</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5onfehqbdju.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The most authentic Igbo dressing styles you will love</span></p></a><p class=align-left>For example, the Igbu Ichi marks on the face make a man honorable and acceptable everywhere he goes. Only free men were given such honor. They were provided with good food before the procedure of cutting the marks in order to have physical strength to stand the pain.</p><p class=align-left>Then, he was led to a specially dug pit where he was laid on the ground face up and a special Ogbu ichi cut the marks in his face with the help of a sharp knife. The best valor the man could show during the procedure was not to give any signs of fear or pain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4cmrt635sa8.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Igbo traditional wedding attire for the bride</p><p class=align-left>After the cuts were applied, they were sprinkled with charcoal dust. This was the end of the procedure and the man was led into a separate room where he was treated carefully and caringly and given any delicious food he would demand. After the wounds healed up, he became a man of an exceptional honor, bravery and, of course, bodily beauty.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2en3mfkmgj.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cultural similarities and differences in Nigeria</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Other types of marks were used to tell free people from slaves or simply for decoration.

The majority of adults only cared to cover their private parts. Children had no clothes at all up to a certain adolescent age when their parents decided that it’s time to start hiding certain parts of their bodies. Seniors wore more clothes and often a string of beads in their waist area because it was considered healing.</p><p class=align-left>Before the colonization, the only clothes that could be seen on both men and women were wrappers decorated with beads. Men also used loin clothes that could be worn alone or under a wrapper. Women never covered their chests and only wore necklaces and beads.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytoe58lfgvm0o.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The magic of the Yoruba tribe</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5atemfr906i.jpg><p class=align-left>Today, when they are into getting dressed in a traditional style, men usually wear Isiagu, a top with embroidery on the chest, paired with pants. They also cover their heads with traditional hats called Okpu Agu.
