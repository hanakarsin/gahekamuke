While many TV shows often suggest that a case can be wrapped up in a matter of days, Sunny explains that the reality is often the total opposite of what viewers see.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: investigation discovery</span></figure><p>In Truth About Murder, she aims to show that police officers and prosecutors care about the cases that they're assigned to, but murderers are also often clever and it can be difficult, if sometimes impossible, to prove someone's guilt.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Sunny's childhood informed her interest in hearing victims' perspectives.</h2><p>Unlike many of the<a href=#> other true-crime shows</a> on air today, Truth About Murder with Sunny Hostin is a little bit different. That's because Sunny provides a voice to the victims of these terrible and often brutal crimes.</p><p>While most TV shows only focus on the criminals, the crimes they commit and the legal system that attempts or fails to bring them to justice, Truth About Murder offers the perspective of the actual victims, people Sunny feels don't get enough of a voice on these types of shows. "This show is different," she tells <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>. "I don't think there's anything out there like it."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: investigation discovery</span></figure><p>"I know how it feels to be a victim and I want others to understand it," she continues. A traumatic incident with her own family led Sunny to be interested in stories about justice from an early age. At the young age of 7, Sunny went through one of the most defining moments of her childhood when she witnessed her favorite uncle being stabbed with a butcher knife.</p><p>Although her uncle survived the initial attack, she says that he was changed by his stabbing and carried the physical and emotional scars from the incident. He died years later from complications caused by the violent attack.</p><p>While Sunny is opening up about her family's trauma now, she says that her family never spoke of the incident and the assailant was never punished for his crime. "These things affect the community, the cops, the doctors, for a lifetime," she told Variety. "I think people want closure. They want to know the person is in jail."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>The lack of justice in the case her family experienced stuck with Sunny, who held that moment close to her heart as she went on to become a federal prosecutor. Sunny also wants to help families process their trauma through talking about it, because her own family was never able to. According to a Discovery group president, who heads ID, where her new show will air, "[Sunny's] empathy is absolutely vital."</p><p>"It comes across in the early shots and early tapes we are seeing," he said to Variety back in April. Above all, Sunny wants to continue to give a voice to the voiceless through her show so that more viewers can take action in their own lives.</p><p>Truth About Murder with Sunny Hostin will not be about sensational cases that true-crime shows usually focus on. Instead, the team tells stories that are about the humanity of the victims so that everyday people can see themselves represented, and take their own recourse if they're going through similar events in their own lives.</p><p>Truth About Murder with Sunny Hostin premieres Oct. 23 at 10 p.m. on Discovery's Investigation Discovery network.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMKvuthmn6irpJ67brrEsGSsoJ%2Bs</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
