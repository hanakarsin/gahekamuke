Five years later, she is still a BOM (Boards of Management) teacher.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/cf48c253d28de48b.jpeg><p class=align-left>BOM teachers are trained educators who are yet to be absorbed by TSC and are employed by board schools to bolster their teaching unit, especially in subjects with staff deficiency.</p><p class=align-left>Some earn from as little as KSh 5,000, a figure that rises to KSh 40,000 depending on the institution's financial abilities.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/965f3fdb9f6966d9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rapper Breeder dragged online after claiming he charges KSh 1 million for shows</span></p></a>"I have been trying my luck ever since 2017. TSC employs teachers based on their year of graduation. Marks are awarded based on that, but the funny part is when you find yourself a BOM teacher in a school with a TSC-employed teacher who graduated in 2020," said Eva.<p class=align-left>She added that an opportunity to get absorbed once knocked at her door, but it came with strings attached.</p>"My immediate former boss is a sister-in-law to one of the MPs. There is a day he told her to look for market for TSC employment forms which were retailing at KSh 250,000. She approached me, but I didn't have the money. Someone else paid the money and joined last year January," she continued.<p class=align-left>That is the same case with Dorothy Kagure, who has been out for 10 years now without being absorbed. As a BOM teacher, she makes roughly KSh 15,000 per month, making it a poor return on an investment after all the time and fees in college.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f9de006818fb99e5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Job promotion woes: Demotivated teacher pens piece on why he no longer fancies the noble job</span></p></a>"They recently announced job opportunities, but it is difficult to get because half the vacancies are filled by handpicked candidates. See, they said that we should not apply because the 2020 merit list is to be used. Now that is where nepotism will come into play," she lamented.<p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> Help us change more lives, join TUKO.co.ke’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Patreon programme</a></p><p class=align-left>For Martha Malumbe Makwata, it has been 12 years of trying and failing. With all hopes gone, she decided to venture into the grocery <a href=#>business</a> to fend for her children.</p>"I have worked as a relief teacher, yet I am still waiting for employment in the dark for the past 12 years. I have kids whose father died, and I look at them, waiting for the peanuts I get as a BoG teacher. I had to become a mama mboga to survive as I wait for employment that I have no idea how many more years it will take. It just wears me up," complained Martha.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs65njuuc2h7q.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Moi University lecturers strike, refuse to sign new contracts over salary delays</span></p></a><p class=align-left>All the negative factors remaining constant, some teachers, especially those for secondary school, have also been disadvantaged due to wrong subject combinations.</p><p class=align-left>In other words, choices that are flooded with students are in plenty in the job market too.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong><a href=#>Click 'See First' under 'Follow' Tab to see TUKO.co.ke news on your FB Feed</a></p><p class=align-left>Combinations like Physics and Chemistry, Maths and Chemistry or Physics and Maths have fewer students who are mostly absorbed as soon as they graduate.</p><p class=align-left>However, English and Literature, Kiswahili, History and CRE, or Maths and Geography take longer periods to be absorbed.</p><p class=align-left>This is against the backdrop of the education sector, experiencing a deficit of teachers countrywide.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Hillary Lisimba Ambani is a graduate of the University of Nairobi’s School of Journalism with an illustrious career in Print, Broadcast and Online journalism.
