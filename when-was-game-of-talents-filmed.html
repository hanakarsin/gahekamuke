For example, two or three episodes of The Price Is Right can be filmed on the same day ‚Äî that's a lot of base model Hyundai Elantras being handed out. That's why a lot of <a href=#>Game of Talents</a> fans want to know when the show was filmed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Just when was 'Game of Talents' filmed?</h2><p>Fox announced on Feb. 8, 2021, that GOT (no, not that GOT) would premiere on March 10 right after The Masked Singer's Season 5 debut. It's a huge vote of confidence from the network as TMS is one of the highest-rated TV programs on network television right now, despite many people claiming it's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"the worst show" they have ever seen</a>.</p><p>However, news that the show was ordered dates back as far as November in 2020, where it was revealed that Wayne Brady of Whose Line Is It Anyway? and one-of-the-greatest-Chappelle's-Show-sketches-of-all-time fame would take over hosting duties for the program.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> published that the show was in development back then, so it could be that a large number of episodes were filmed towards the end of the year until after the New Year began in 2021.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span></figure><p>Game of Talents looks to follow the formula that made TMS such a huge success: Take a foreign unscripted series' and then adapt it for American audiences. While TMS was first a smashing success in South Korea, it became a worldwide phenomenon once it debuted in the U.S.&nbsp;</p><p>GOT is originally a Spanish TV show that features two teams of two vying for a huge cash prize.</p><p>The contestants must decipher what secret skills "mystery performers" possess, and the ones who get the right answer will walk away with a whopping $200,000. That's a life-changing amount of moolah for looking at impressions and trying to read clues in highly pressurized situations.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Our new hidden talent is Lion Tamer. ü¶Å What's yours?! <a href=#>#GameOfTalentsUS</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/B7iJMNGnaG</a></p>‚Äî Game of Talents (@TalentsonFOX) <a href=#>March 24, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Where is 'Game of Talents' filmed?</h2><p>Fox clearly has high hopes for its newest game show, and it's headed by Fremantle, a Los Angeles-based company that reportedly is filming the series at 300 E Ocean Boulevard in Long Beach, Calif., home of the Long Beach Performing Arts Center. It's a jaw-droppingly large venue, perfect for housing the massive-scale sets that make the show such an awesome spectacle to watch.</p><p>The set design itself was reportedly finished in December of 2020, further solidifying that the show was more than likely filmed with contestants right around the time of January 2021.</p><p>While Game of Talents is a new show, the location in which it's being shot has a long and storied history in California. It has a capacity of up to 14,500 depending on seating structures and boasts a whopping 46,000 square feet.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Did anyone else immediately order üçï after Justin's performance? üòÑ <a href=#>#GameOfTalentsUS</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/N53cE9bwnU</a></p>‚Äî Game of Talents (@TalentsonFOX) <a href=#>March 21, 2021</a></figure><p>The 1984 Summer Olympics were hosted here, along with concerts from iconic artists like the Eagles, Iron Maiden, and Elvis Presley.</p><p>Rob Wade, President, Alternative Entertainment and Specials for Fox, said, "Game of Talents represents everything we here at Fox endeavor to bring to viewers.
