It has enriched our lives economically because when we milk our cows, there is a ready market every day. I used to depend much on planting maize and beans, but rains kept failing so many times and that left me with no food and source of income,”</i> said Njule.<p class=align-left>Njule revealed he is now a proud owner of eight cows which offer him an average of over 90 litres a day.</p><p class=align-left>In Dembwa Village, in Mwatate, we meet Winnie Katini, who once depended on poultry farming for commercial purposes.</p><p class=align-left>She kept over 60 hens which laid a few eggs though some of hens died.</p><i>“I bought one freshian cow through a loan from “chama” in 2006. Later, I decided to improve the breed through and now I have three cows,"</i> she said.<p class=align-left>Katini says the subsidized artificial insemination services introduced by the county government will largely boost milk production in the region.</p><p class=align-left>The dairy sector in Taita Taveta is emerging as a potentially profitable investment for small-scale farmers. Maziwa Taita, which was established in 2009 with the support from Brookside Dairies Limited, has been mobilising farmers to collect milk in different parts of the county and now it has become a dairy cooperative.</p><p class=align-left>The drought which occurs in the region has not deterred dairy farmers from their new venture.</p><p class=align-left>For instance, Kishushe Hay Group, a community group, harvests hay from a community ranch of about 60,000 acres.</p><p class=align-left>Annually, the group harvests 4, 500 bales from river banks that cuts across the ranch. Dairy farmers are able to buy the hay during dry seasons to feed their cows.</p><i>“The hay comes in handy during dry seasons when animal crop is hard to find. I buy a bale of hay for Ksh200. This helps because the dairy cows risk dying due to lack of proper feeding,”</i> said Mwaluma one of the dairy farmers in Mwatate constituency.<p class=align-left>Livestock department records showed that Taita Taveta county produces 21 million kilograms of milk annually, which translates to 60,000 litres daily.</p><p class=align-left>The county administration sees this as way below the expectations, given the potential of the region where its climate is conducive for dairy farming especially in the upper zones.</p><p class=align-left>The county government plans to strengthen the dairy cooperative society to promote bulking and cooling in various areas to preserve milk.</p><p class=align-left>The County Government also plans to work with stakeholders in the industry to increase the number of dairy cows through the women and youth groups.</p><p class=align-left>Brookside Dairy, which processes more than 45% of all milk produced in the county, said it will enhance the operational capacity of the Wumingu cooling plant in Wundanyi to enable it to cool 10,000 litres of milk per day from 7,000 litres.</p><p class=align-left>Given the recent trends showing an increase for milk demand in the coastal counties, the Taita Taveta County Government has strengthened the dairy farming in various sub-counties.</p><p class=align-left>In June 2018, the county government introduced subsidised Artificial Insemination (AI) to boost dairy farming. Taita Taveta farmers have lauded the County Government for significantly reducing the cost of AI services from KSh 2000 to KSh 200.</p><p class=align-left>More than 10,000 dairy farmers are set to benefit from the AI services. Previously, before the AI services were subsidized, dairy farmers were forced to use local bulls for breeding purposes which resulted to low milk production.</p><p class=align-left>The low milk production forced farmers to earn too little to afford quality feeds and other important mineral supplements for their cows.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Story by Monica Wambugha, TUKO.co.ke correspondent in Taita Taveta county.</i></strong></p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a life-changing story you would like us to publish?
