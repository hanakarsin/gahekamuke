The game, which is set to release exclusively on PlayStation consoles in <a href=#>November 2022</a>, is one of the most anticipated video game titles of the year â€” and amid the Norse apocalypse, this father-son duo will have some new foes to face.</p><p>Leading up to the game's release, Santa Monica Studios has kept many details and spoilers as quiet as possible â€” but that hasn't stopped fans from sharing their theories as to what (or who) exactly the pair could be up against.</p><p>Any <a href=#>Marvel</a> fan will be at least semi-familiar with the Norse RagnarÃ¶k, thanks to the legion of movies centered around Thor.

In the dream, Thor summons a storm outside of Kratos and Atreus' house, calling the pair out of their slumber into a confrontation â€” supposedly to seek revenge on the pair for killing both Magni and Modi (Thor's sons) and his half brother Baldur.</p><p>Kratos awakes to tell his son of this dream, leaving players with little else of the God of Thunder, and it appears that he will indeed make a reappearance in the upcoming sequel.</p><p>Thor is confirmed to be a part of God of War RagnarÃ¶k, though the developers have not yet revealed in what capacity. Many are anticipating him to appear as one of the primary antagonists of the game alongside Freya, who has already been confirmed to reappear in the sequel.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kratos vs Thor | God Of War Ragnarok 2022 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Ch252RAHk9</a></p>â€” Le Monde De Playstation ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ºðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ (@LeMondeDePSX) <a href=#>January 30, 2022</a></figure><p>As both Thor and Freya are connected to Baldur, with Freya being his estranged mother, it's theorized the pair will work together to attempt to take down Kratos and Atreus, seeking vengeance for the deaths of their family members.</p><p>At this time, nothing else is known about Thor's role in the upcoming game, though players can expect him to be a prominent recurring character in the new game.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who will voice Thor in the upcoming game?</h2><p>Though you may be used to <a href=#>Chris Hemsworth</a>'s rendition of Thor, featuring a six-pack of abs and flowing locks, the Thor you'll find in RagnarÃ¶k will align closer with the Norse mythology description of the god.
