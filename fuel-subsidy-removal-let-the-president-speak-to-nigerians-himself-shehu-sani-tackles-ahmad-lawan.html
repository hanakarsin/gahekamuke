And for us, as parliamentarians, as legislators representing the people of Nigeria, this must be of interest to us.</p><p>“And we’ve just finished our recess, we had gone home to our constituencies and senatorial districts. And will feel the pulse of our people. And I found it necessary to visit Mr President, as the leader of our government and our leader in the country, to discuss this particular issue of concern to Nigerians, and I’m happy to inform Nigerians that Mr President never told anyone that the petroleum subsidy should be removed,” Lawan had declared.</p><p>But taking to his Twitter account, Sani on Wednesday said the position of President Buhari on fuel subsidy removal should be heard by Nigerians directly from him or through his spokespersons or Ministers and not the Senate President.</p><p>Sani wrote: “The position of the President on Petroleum subsidy should be heard directly from the President or the spokesperson of the President or the Minister of state for Petroleum or the Minister of Finance and not from the Senate President.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5ByZp%2BtlaF6tMHBrKCdsV2nsq671ZqjZqSVqXq1tMRmp6udo56xprrTZqqpnZGgerW7jKegoJ2inq6vv4yhoKarlaGzbr%2FHnp%2BuZaOWu6p505qapKSVqHqitMyam2akkayur3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
