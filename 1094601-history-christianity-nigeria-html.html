Depending on the year of the survey conducted as well as the organization that conducted it, the numbers differ as well as the ratio of Muslims to Christians.</p><p class=align-left>Thus, for instance, in 2008, the survey by one organization showed that there are at least 53% Muslims, and 45% Christians, while the other study demonstrated other numbers which were 50% Christians and 49% Muslims. Meanwhile, the research by the Pew Research Center that same year showed at least 52% Muslims, 46% Christians, and 1% non-religious individuals.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Soyinka is unfair, Christianity is a peaceful religion - CAN</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9734dbd923b129f5.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How 2 useless presidential candidates will emerge in 2023 - Sanusi goes prophetic</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Nevertheless, they say that the Northern states are where most Muslims live which Christians can be found mostly in the South of the country.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9734dbd923b129f5.png><p class=align-left>According to ot the Nigeria Christian Fellowship, there are at least seventy million people who consider themselves Christians. Other sources mention that this number is around eighty-five million. Despite the violence and persecution which follows those not supporting Islam in the different area but opt for Christianity or staying away from any religion, the number of Christianity adherers constantly grows.</p><p class=align-left>This fact only proves what God said about those who will persecute those loving Jesus. Here are a few verses about it in the Bible.</p><p class=align-left><i>“Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.” (2 Timothy 3:12)</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange was happening to you. But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and God rests upon you.” (1 Peter 4:12-14)</i></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/64135b2144da28fc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Be nice to bandits, Sheikh Gumi tells Nigerians, releases tips on how to live peacefully with them</span></p></a><p class=align-left><i>“Blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil, on account of the Son of Man!” (Luke 6:22)</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytshfihdst9h8.jpg><p class=h2>The beginning of the history of Christianity in Nigeria</p><p class=align-left>The history of this religion actually roots back to the days when Jesus commanded to take the Good News that He saves those believing and trusting Him to the ends of the world. This happened after He resurrected and showed up to the disciples.</p><p class=align-left>“Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” (Matthew 28:19-20)</p><p class=align-left>From that time on, the first Christians took the Gospel to all the ends of the world including the places where Nigeria is now.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2dcc40a9dcea10c3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Yemi Osinbajo reveals why FG is not planning to increase taxes</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Bulus Y. Galadima and Yusufu Turaki explored the spread of Christianity of Nigeria in the work they called “Christianity of Nigeria.”</p><p class=align-left>To provide the clear understanding of how this religion came to Nigeria, we have to mention that the state we know today was divided into several regions which had their own social and economic conditions which either stimulate the spread of it or prevented it from it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/64135b2144da28fc.jpg><p class=h2>Christianity in the South of Nigeria</p><p class=align-left>Thus, in the South of Nigeria, mostly Yoruba and Edo groups were ruling and dominating. They had their own particular system of laws, administrative organization, and the strong influence of the traditionalists’ power.</p><p class=align-left>Another important fact about this region is that to the West of the territory Nigeria has today, people were often enslaved or involved in slavery which came to this land in the seventeenth century. This influenced the country greatly too. Unfortunately, a lot of conflicts, sometimes even military ones took place here and in between the tribes. As a result of such unstable situation, the Christian missions only got here in the 1840s.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a98c665d793c719a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why I don't want to become godfather like Oshiomhole, Tinubu - Obaseki gives reasons</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, at the same time, the Fulani and Jihadists forced people living in the North to support Islam. The Eastern territories had no structure or organization in their lands. In facts, when the scientists call the Middle Belt of the country, was an area with no systems of one law and political systems.</p><p class=align-left>Nevertheless, when Christianity came here around the same time it did to the Western part, it met no obstacles in spreading.It It is important to realize that the religions in Nigeria were all influenced by the common traditionalists’ beliefs and superstitions. People accepted Jesus Christ but still had the mentality impacted by the indigenous religions.</p><p class=align-left>The good news for the Christianity is that Islam did not come to this region until in the 1970s the civil war broke out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6skhm4a5889.jpg><p class=h2>The origin of Christianity in the North of Nigeria</p><p class=align-left>The northern area of the state was where Hausa and Bornu people lived. However, there were at least 250 other ethnic groups who were either Muslims or adherers of other religions. The Muslims started the slave trade in this region.

They believed in evil spirits, and other things peculiar to this religion. The origin of Christianity in Nigeria in this part roots back to the 1930s when Christians were allowed to enter the territory which was previously closed to them by the Muslims.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2dcc40a9dcea10c3.jpg><p class=h3>History of religion in the Hausa tribe</p><p class=align-left>One of the few ethnic groups that were always open to the influence of different religions is the Hausa people.
