This temple is 1200 years old, and it was carved from the solid rock. How the heck did they do it?</strong></p><p>This one is called a Kailasa temple, and it is found in the west of India. This Hindu temple is unusual and impossible. It locates 34 monasteries on its territory amounting to two kilometers. The temple itself is 50 meters deep, 30 meters high and 33 meters wide.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;Might these be the signs from God telling us He is coming soon?</p><p>And it’s a monolith! This means the temple is one of the hugest monolith constructions in the world and mind you, it was built over 1000 years ago! How could they possibly make something like that?! Huge pillars at the entrance are also carved from solid rock.</p><p>The whole thing may weigh over 400 000 tons. Scientists believe it took them centuries to build the amazing structure. All the walls are magnificently crafted with great care.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;He got bees on his tale – 20 000 swarm chasing a car!</p><p>It seems like they started to build the temple back in the 3rd century, but they finished it up only in the 8th centuries, 500 years later. No one knows who or how has built the temple. Could the ancient people erect it using just simple tools, such as picks and hammers?</p><p>They apparently lacked the technology to do it. Some even believe the place was built by aliens. Well, we do not know that for sure, but the structure is rather striking, and it’s hard to believe human hands have crafted it out of sheer rock.</p><p>Сохранить</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB9k3Bwb2hdqrujscuinK%2BZkqGybrnArKqirpViwaa5z6WcZpuRp8OmsIyspqWhlGK%2FsK%2FKZpinm5mau7V5z56mqaSVY7W1ucs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
