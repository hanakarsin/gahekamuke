So you think the show's makers would have given the finale a look over before it hit television screens. Unfortunately, some eagle eyed fans spotted a plastic water bottle in Episode 6.&nbsp;</p><p>The bottle was spotted during the King's Council, and this time it seems pretty clear who the offending item belongs to. While people may have laughed at Samwell Tarly, played by John Bradley, for suggesting democracy as a solution, he seems to have secured the last laugh. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Samwell Tarley: I wonder if my foot is blocking this water bottle.<br>Also Sam: I wonder if anyone even knows who the F is seated to my right.<a href=#>#GameOfThrones</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7tl8KpQeRg</a></p>‚Äî Patrick Driscoll (@P_Drizzzle) <a href=#>May 20, 2019</a></figure><p>Yes, Samwell Tarly invented plastic.

Less than 24 hours after the coffee cup incident, the cup was removed from HBO's own on demand platforms and the corrected version slowly made it out to their partners.&nbsp;</p><p>Game of Thrones executive producer Bernie Caulfield appeared on the <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>‚ÄúAll of It‚Äù</strong></a> during the social media craziness and downplayed the mistake.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs the worst thing they‚Äôre finding, then we‚Äôre in good shape,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe [it]!
