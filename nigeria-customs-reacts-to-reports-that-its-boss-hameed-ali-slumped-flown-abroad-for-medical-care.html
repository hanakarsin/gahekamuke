Hameed Ibrahim Ali (Rtd.), is hale and hearty, and not ill as reported by an online media outlet. While the motive for concocting this story is unknown to the service, we want to reassure all our stakeholders and well-meaning Nigerians that all is well health-wise with the Comptroller General.</p><p>“We believe that good health and life itself are gifts from God Almighty and those to whom these gifts are bestowed are blessed indeed.</p><p>“Anyone who will think so negatively as to attribute ill health to a healthy person should be mindful of the legal consequences of spreading falsehood and take cognizance of the fact that karma itself is unsparing in its exactitude.</p><p>“The Comptroller General who throughout his tenure has sacrificed his time and energy to drive the reforms agenda of this administration has earned remarkable successes in restructuring and raising unprecedented revenue for the Service,” the statement reads.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5FwZqehl5q%2Fqq2MnKysrJ%2BiwG6%2BxJqaratdqbxuvsSppquso2LBqa3TZqCtq12XvLS%2FjKGYpp2VmXqiuMhmqqWtnaWypXnFpaawpl2Wr7O7wJ1kn6eiYrqmsMicmKVlk5a%2Fpns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
