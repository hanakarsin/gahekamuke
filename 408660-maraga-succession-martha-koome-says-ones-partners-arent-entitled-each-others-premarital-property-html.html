If I got married today, I have my property; my spouse would not be entitled to my property, the one I had before marriage. If he is a man and got married when he already had the property, that is his property. But when the lady comes in and they developed it further, she, of course, acquires occupational rights. Once you live in it and create other rights within, those rights can be claimed," </i>she responded.<p class=align-left>The lady justice was responding to justice Mohamed Warsame, who sought to know her views on marital property rights during the vetting exercise, which entered its third day on Wednesday, April 14.</p><h2>Feminism</h2><p class=align-left>On feminist legal theories, Koome observed that the law corresponds with patriarchal dominance since the laws are made in male-dominated parliaments.</p><i>"Laws are made in parliament and the dormant majority in parliament is male.
