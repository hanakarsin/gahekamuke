(<a href=#>Chase Stokes</a>) discovers that his father, <a href=#>Big John</a>, is alive and well, and the father-son duo embarks on the adventure of a lifetime. With John B.’s dad returning to the picture, you might be wondering about his mom. What happened to her?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to John B.’s mom in ‘Outer Banks.’</h2><p>In the Outer Banks Season 1 pilot, John B. reveals that he’s not in contact with either of his parents. As we know, the Pogue member’s father disappeared at sea while searching for a shipwreck. During the first episode, John B. stated that he hadn’t seen his father in nine months.</p><p>However, his mother had been out of the picture for far longer. When the Outer Banks character was 3 years old, his mother left him and his father. “Last I heard, she was in Colorado,” John B. said while holding a photo of his parents. “I think it was Colorado.”</p><p>But given the series’ abundance of plot twists, viewers refused to accept such a vague explanation regarding John B.’s mother.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans theorized Carla Limbrey is John B.’s mom.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@notsocriticallyacclaimed href=#>@notsocriticallyacclaimed</a><p>What other theories should we discuss?? <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> <a title=obx href=#>#obx</a> <a title=outerbanks href=#>#outerbanks</a> <a title=obxseason2 href=#>#obxseason2</a> <a title=theories href=#>#theories</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Not So Critically Ac" href=#>♬ original sound - Not So Critically Ac</a></figure><p>One of the most popular Outer Banks Season 2 theories involved Ward’s former business partner, <a href=#>Carla Limbrey</a> (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth Mitchell</a>). According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@notsocriticallyacclaimed</a> on TikTok, some fans believed Carla was secretly one of the Pogues’ mothers — specifically John B., JJ, or Sarah.</p><p>However, the theory that Carla was John B.’s mom didn’t hold up when considering the series pilot. One user pointed out that the Season 2 character couldn’t possibly be John B.’s mother because she didn’t look like the woman in the framed photo of his parents in Season 1, Episode 1.</p><p>Several fans thought Carla shared a different familial connection with John B. “I think Limbrey is Big John's sister,” one user commented. While it’s unlikely Carla is the Pogue member’s mother, could she possibly be his aunt?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">John B. and Big John reunite in ‘Outer Banks’ Season 3.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>The <a href=#>finale of Outer Banks Season 2</a> revealed that John B.’s dad was very much alive. And in Season 3, John B. reunites with his father, Big John, after he and the Pogues end up on the island he’s been stranded on. For nine episodes, the father and son bond over danger and drama. But unfortunately, their time together doesn't last long.</p><p>In the Outer Banks Season 3 finale, Big John, unfortunately, gets shot and dies in his son’s arms. With one parent tragically out of his life, will it be cause for John B.’s mother to make an appearance in <a href=#>Season 4</a>?</p><p>Season 3 of Outer Banks is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSjp5ijeqO%2FjKampmWfqsGmvoybmKejow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
