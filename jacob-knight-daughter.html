Thankfully, Jacob isn’t shy about sharing photos of his firstborn on Instagram.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jacob Knight's daughter is named Sunset.</h2><p>The 23-year-old and his girlfriend Angie welcomed their baby girl on Nov. 6, 2019. Though the real estate agent limited his social media activity surrounding the pregnancy and birth following nasty comments from trolls, he opened up about becoming a father on Love & Listings.</p><p>"Ain’t no time for games. It’s time to step up," Jacob told the camera before his daughter’s arrival. "I hope I’m the best dad. I hope I’m ready. But it’s just like… this s--t is scary."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The reality star added that his baby mama, who owns a floral design company called The Rose Clique, is the reason why he’s "more structured" than a lot of his peers. He also credits his dad, music mogul <a href=#>Suge Knight</a>, for inspiring his strong work ethic.</p><p>"I mean, why not real estate? In this field, I want to get out of my father’s shadow," Jacob explained on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Access Live</a> last year, while also admitting, "I want to make him proud the best way I can."</p><p>One of the reasons why Jacob signed on to do Love & Listings was to help repair his family’s legacy following his dad’s many legal troubles. The Death Row Records cofounder is currently serving a 28-year prison sentence after pleading no contest to voluntary manslaughter in a fatal 2015 hit-and-run.</p><p>"I’m bringing light to my family name and showing that there’s a different side to my father," the aspiring rapper told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a> in 2019. "The notorious Suge Knight actually has a beautiful family and is a real good father. People wouldn’t expect that."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jacob said he doesn't want to emulate his dad's personal life.</h2><p>Though the Coldwell Banker agent referred to Suge as a "superhero," he’s determined to learn from his father’s mistakes. "My dad has seven baby mamas. I’m not gonna be doing that," Jacob stated on Love & Listings.</p><p>"You know, growing up, my dad was always gone. My dad put in a lot of work, but you know… I’ll probably be there in my kid’s life more," he continued. "Me being able to be a father is… it’s an opportunity that I get to do and recreate my own story — I ain’t gonna leave my baby."</p><p>Jacob added that he wants to be a role model for children and teens who have one or both of their parents in jail. "I want to inspire those kids. I measure my success by how I inspire people," he shared.</p><p>New episodes of Love & Listings air Mondays at 9 p.m. ET on VH1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn66ku8Fmoqehl53BbrDArp6hrJWn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
