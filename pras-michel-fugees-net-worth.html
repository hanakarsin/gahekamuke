If he's convicted, the artist could be sent to federal prison for decades.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Per prosecutors John<strong> </strong>Keller, Sean Mulryne, and Nicole Lockhart, via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a>, Pras is accused of receiving "over $100 million from Jho Low, a foreign fugitive responsible for one of the largest embezzlement schemes in history."</p><p>According to investigators, Pras decided to "use backchannel influence to convince the then-President of the United States to drop a federal investigation into Low and to agree to the extrajudicial removal of a Chinese exile living in the United States."</p><p>There are two alleged sets of crimes that Pras's is "in the middle of," according to prosecutors. The first one is a plan to illegally solicit individuals to attend former President Obama's 2012 presidential fundraiser dinner, reimburse those invited the $40,000 ticket cost through money from foreign entities, and threaten them if they came clean to authorities.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Secondly, Pras was allegedly part of a secret lobbying campaign to put pressure on American officials when Low's fraud scheme came to light. On top of that, the plan was allegedly intended to help the Chinese government "secure the return" of a dissident and develop ties with Steve Bannon, a former associate of former President Trump.</p><p>Pras is continuously denying that he worked as an agent for China. The artist is being represented by defense lawyers David Kenner and Charles Haskell.
