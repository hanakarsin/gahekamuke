If you work in a somewhat conservative setting that allows one to wear dreads, the low ponytail is inarguably one of the most elegant ways to style them.</p><h4>2. Fade with dreads</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/619927f80b919c6f.jpeg><p class=align-left>The classic fade has been a staple of male fashion for decades. Men with dreadlocks can incorporate various fades to give the locs an even better look. Feel free to try the different types of fades (low, mid, or high) and see which one works best with your dreads.</p><p class=align-left>The low tapered fade results in a clean, professional look. The mid or temp fade is the perfect balance between low and high fade and bold and classy. If you feel bold enough with your locs, try pairing them with a high fade cut.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/994909ab7614347b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20+ Ghana weaving styles for oval face</span></p></a><h4>3. Bold mohawk</h4><p class=align-left>The mohawk is arguably the boldest dreads men's style today. It is no surprise that there are numerous ways to wear your locs in a mohawk. The resulting look is quite cool and can be created with a tapered fade on the sides. Additionally, you can try the look with undercut or shaved sides.</p><h4>4. Undercut dreadlocks</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/e9a69e3fd0f8d88e.jpeg><p class=align-left>To emphasize your undercut dread locks hairstyle, try pairing your locs with an undercut. The undercut creates short hair on the sides, cut to a uniform length all around. The resulting stylish and handsome look is one of the best dread styles for guys right now.</p><p class=align-left>Short dreadlocks on top of the head keep the look classic and tight. Pairing the undercut with longer hair creates a fashionable look that is super easy to pull off. Undercut locs look great with black hair.</p><h4>5. Curly locs</h4><p class=align-left>You can curl your locs for a bold and stylish look. You can try various curl lengths to create varying looks and textures.

Still, the crisscross design also looks amazing on people with long locs. So feel free to let the lower half of the locs hang freely.</p><h4>7. Short locs</h4><p class=align-left>While many people envision having long dreads, short locs are more versatile and easier to style. Beginners can start with low-maintenance styles, such as those with tapered or undercut sides.</p><h4>8. Bro flow</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/709d51b6a4b6eafa.jpeg><p class=align-left>The bro flow is among the best long dread hairstyles for guys looking for an effortless and relaxed look. The flowing long locs are swept away from the face and then cut to shoulder length. Keep in mind that only those with significantly long dreads can wear this style. Feel free to let the hair strands flow or tie them up in a ponytail.</p><h4>9. Braided dreadlocks</h4><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4ba3c13195a2a753.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ best hair quotes for Instagram to showcase your hairstyle</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Braided dreadlocks are somewhat similar to <a href=#>cornrows</a>. However, cornrows are created using small strands of hair gathered on the scalp. <a href=#>Braided locs</a> are achieved using thicker dreadlocked hair braided all over the head or on the scalp, depending on one's preference.</p><h4>10. Hippie dreadlocks</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e2ef86edb0d61104.jpeg><p class=align-left>This style is ideal for those looking to give their hair some time to relax and move freely. Simply put, this style lets your locks flow freely without the tension on the hair often associated with gathering hair into buns, ponytails, or pigtails.</p><h4>11. Grey dreadlocks</h4><p class=align-left>The fact that grey locs look amazing highlights how amazing the hairstyle works for men of every age. As a growing fashion trend, more and more older people can be seen spotting grey locs that only seem to get cooler as the years go by.</p><h4>12. Dreadlocked rows</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/75cb1a557aa38712.jpeg><p class=align-left>Rows can be braided or twisted into one's scalp regardless of the thickness of the locs. The dreadlocked rows style is considerably tricky to pull off but is definitely one of the most stylish ones. Again, consult your hairstylist on the best way to achieve the look.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a1071b05ea4445cc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>11 best Edgar haircuts for men in 2020</span></p></a><h4>13. Dyed dreads</h4><p class=align-left>This is the ultimate way to wear dreads for bold people. Dyed locs give one the option to incorporate various colours into their hairstyle. The dyed look can be fascinating with a combination of colours such as red, white, and blonde. However, be careful when using dyes. Some can damage your scalp and hair strands.</p><h4>14. Basketweave dreadlocks</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/1c8cd7018a0fd3aa.jpeg><p class=align-left>As the name suggests, this style resembles the strands on a woven basket. Basketweave dreadlocks work with hair of any length but are best applied on long locs. You will want to seek out a skilled hairstylist's services for the best outcome.</p><h4>15. Short ombre locks</h4><p class=align-left>The ombre shading technique is among today's trendiest dreadlocks hairstyles. Feel free to try the ombre effect in a gradual shift from black at the roots to blond at the tips. The resulting trendy look explains why the ombre look is all the rage right now.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1a31a58f44080ce9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bowl cut girl ideas - 20+ pictures</span></p></a><h4>16.

The tone adds edge, class, and a nice depth to the hair. Feel free to try any two complementary colours to create your tone.</p><h4>19. Free boho locs</h4><p class=align-left>For a chunkier take on the hippie style, try out some free-flowing boho locs. Typically, this style requires quite some patience for it to appear, but it is well worth the wait. Feel free to use some cool grips to give extra flair to your locs.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs3ntmhtg5atc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>60 messy hairstyles for men trending in 2020</span></p></a><h4>20.

Wool dreads</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/1668635edf686563.jpeg><p class=align-left>Wrapping locs with wool began as a protective measure designed to prevent frizzing. However, with time, the <a href=#>wool dreads</a> became a fashion statement. You can try different wool colours for various outcomes. Some of the most common include white, black, brown, and blond. Keep in mind that wool dreads become extremely heavy when wet and often take longer to dry.</p><h4>25. Crinkle dreads</h4><p class=align-left>Crinkle locs are a quirky and fun twist to the conventional dreadlocks style. The process to get crinkle dreads is similar to that of wavy locs. Begin by making your locs wet, then plait them into three huge braids. Tuck the braids into a hairband and leave the hair to dry. Afterwards, unbraid the locs to reveal the nice-looking crinkles.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0901db7742eb4bac.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 short dreadlocks styles to try out this year</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When done properly, this style becomes one of the best short loc styles for women.</p><h4>26. Curly locs</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1a31a58f44080ce9.jpeg><p class=align-left>Are you looking for the perfect short dread styles for women? You should consider trying curly locs. This style can be achieved by parting the dreads in the middle and then shaping them like curls. The look closely resembles that of the famous Medusa.</p><h4>27. Mohawk with loopy dreadlocks</h4><p class=align-left>This style combines kinky dreads layered in two heaps, undercut hair, and flat twists. You can also accessorize it with fancy earrings, beads, or cowries to enhance the look. This is one of those locs styles suitable for bold women.</p><h4>28. Wavy dreads</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/8380228252aed208.jpeg><p class=align-left>Wavy dreadlocks are a simple way to change up your style with a playful and romantic result. You can make your dreadlocks wavy using satin-covered or silk hair rollers. Roll and clip them as you would with regular hair, apply setting lotion to damp dreads, and then loosely braid them. Leave the locs to dry for the perfect waves.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/08b95fe4d71921e2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of cute anime girl hairstyles you should check right now</span></p></a><h4>29. Rasta dreads</h4><p class=align-left>Dreadlocks have been associated with Rastafarianism for quite a long time, and rightly so. Well, the Rasta dreads hairdo is among the most common among Rastafarians. It is also among the elegantly simple dreadlocks hairstyles ever. The style is achieved by letting dreads grow freely without using any unnatural techniques to create, rub, roll, or style them. However, they can still be washed like other locs.</p><h4>30. Dreadlocks fishtail</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/018f1eb427c20709.jpeg><p class=align-left>The dreads fishtail is perhaps one of the most artistic ways to wear your locs. Having dreadlocked hair does not mean you have to give upbraiding it. In fact, locs are way easier to braid than regular hair. To get the fishtail look, divide your dreads into thick sections and braid them to form a fishtail-looking design.</p><h4>31. Two-coloured dreads</h4><p class=align-left>If you are worried that your hair might not have sufficient volume to form locs, you could opt for dreads extensions. This will give you the option to experiment with different colours, one on your natural hair and another on the extension. For example, you can opt for natural black dreads with grey extensions.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/01d920e4634a14a5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best fluffy kinky hairstyles to try this year</span></p></a><h4>32.

Take this method a notch higher by styling the locs up into a loopy bun. The resulting look can be worn in both formal and informal settings.</p><h4>33. Dreads with beads</h4><p class=align-left>Very few hairstyles scream fun as beaded dreads do. Feel free to wear your beaded locs down, parted to the sides, or up. Opt for beads in different bright colours for an even more enhanced look.</p><p class=align-left>Beads can be used to accessorize numerous beginner short dreadlocks styles for ladies.</p><h4>34.

Faux locs</h4><p class=align-left>Faux locs are also known as 'fake dreads.' If you love how dreadlocks look but are not willing to invest the time required to grow female natural dreadlocks, faux locs are the way to go. You can achieve the look by having your stylist braid your real hair before wrapping the faux locs around it. The effect can also be achieved using cornrows or crotchets.</p><h4>36. Wavy dreads</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/9c24fa9accb8b78f.jpeg><p class=align-left>Wavy dreads have a relaxed vibe to them.
