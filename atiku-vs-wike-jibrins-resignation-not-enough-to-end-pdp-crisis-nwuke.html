That does not answer the equation question inherent in the PDP Constitution. We must do the needful if we want peace as we get closer to the kick-off of campaigns.”</p><p>Nwuke, however, commended Jibrin for supporting the position of the Wike camp, saying that Ayu has to resign to restore peace to the party.</p><p>He said: “Wahid Jibril is a gentleman. From the beginning, he was always on the path of truth. But that is not enough to balance the imbalanced equation as we see it in the PDP today. The national chairman of the party has to resign. That demand is very key to us.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49yZpqsmaDCbsLSZq6io5Vit6qu0aKlrGWimsCqs82aq6KnnmK7sMCMnqWorZederW7jJ6lnWWgmb1ur9GiqqKrXaPEtrfEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
