Why? Because his body was taken over by God — in a Broadway play, at least.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jim Parsons discussed his religious background in 2015.</h2><p style=text-align:start>In the 2015 Broadway show An Act of God, written by The Last Testament: A Memoir By God author David Javerbaum, Jim played a version of himself inhabited by God. “Celebrities are my chosen people,” God-as-Jim-Parsons <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said in the show</a>. “Celebrities are like me. They’re adored, worshipped, tantrum-prone. We live in our own universe, and our public appearances are limited and for promotional purposes only. I get celebrities — I mean not when they die, but before.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p style=text-align:start>And that divine role had Jim considering his own spirituality, as the actor told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily News</a> at the time. He told the newspaper that he grew up going to church “almost every Sunday.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Lutheranism is “not the strictest” of churches, Jim said.</h2><p style=text-align:start>In that Daily News interview, Jim revealed that he was raised Lutheran. “I don’t go to church anymore. I guess I feel somewhat ill-defined in laying out my beliefs. I feel that there are many forces at work in the world.”</p><p style=text-align:start>And in a sit-down with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Playbill</a>, Jim said that Lutheranism is “not the strictest” of churches. “I mean, they have moral values,” he allowed. “It's just not fire and brimstone.”</p><p style=text-align:start>Because he went to church so often as a youth, the four-time Emmy winner was “pretty familiar with everything” he had to say in An Act of God.</p><p style=text-align:start>Well, not quite everything. “I did have to bone up on the difference between the words ‘omnipotent,’ ‘omnipresent,’ and ‘omniscient,’” Jim told Playbill. “I say them a lot in the show and I have to make sure I keep them straight.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Playing God on stage was “freeing,” Jim said.</h2><p style=text-align:start>Jim hyped up his work in An Act of God in an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon at the time.</p><p style=text-align:start>“The premise is that God has some things he’d like to say to people, and he thinks a good way to do that is Broadway — he’s got a showman type personality,” Jim said on the talk show (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Playbill</a>). “But if he was just God, you wouldn’t be able to hear him or see him. He has to pluck a human body to interpret him.”</p><p style=text-align:start>Acting like God’s vessel was a “freeing premise” for Jim, he told the Tonight Show audience. “I get to say all this stuff about religion and God, but it’s not me!” he told Jimmy with a laugh. “It’s just my body.”</p><p style=text-align:start>And Jim won rave reviews for his performance. “Mr. Parsons’s light Texas drawl makes the Lord seem approachable as opposed to unfathomable, just a nice fellow sitting on the porch … sharing homespun if definitely holier-than-thou wisdom about, well, just about everything to do with his ways and his world,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> critic Charles Isherwood wrote.
