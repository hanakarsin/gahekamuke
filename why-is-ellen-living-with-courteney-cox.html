Despite rumors of divorce and infidelity, the couple seems to be going strong. But recent reports suggest that there may be trouble in paradise.&nbsp;</p><p>On a recent episode of <a href=#>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>, Ellen revealed that she is now staying with her longtime friend, Courteney Cox, in her Beverly Hills mansion. But why is Ellen living with <a href=#>Courteney</a>?&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC / EllenTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is Ellen DeGeneres living with Courteney Cox?</h2><p>On May 6, Ellen revealed that after she and Portia de Rossi sold their estate in Beverly Hills for $47 million, Courteney Cox offered Ellen a place to stay in the interim. In the episode, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellen explained</a>, “The world knows our first guest from a little show called Friends, but currently, I just know her as my landlord."</p><p>Ellen insisted that her newfound living arrangement is only temporary and clarified that her relationship with Portia is still intact. She added, “I should explain. I'm not having marital troubles. I'm not out of my house because I'm — I'm not living with Courteney Cox because I'm kicked out of my house.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC / EllenTube</span></figure><p>Ellen continued, "We sold our house here in Beverly Hills and I needed a place to stay. [Courteney was] kind enough to say, 'Yes, stay at my house.'"</p><p>Ellen and Portia have bought and sold several properties since they began their relationship nearly two decades ago, although Ellen told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> that becoming a real estate tycoon was never her intention. She shared, “I’ve never bought to sell. I always say, ‘This is it. I’m never moving.' People laugh at me now.”</p><p>According to Courteney, although living with one of her besties seemed like a good idea at the time, she later learned that having Ellen as a roommate was much harder than it looked. Courteney told Ellen, "I was just really ready for you, and then my assistant went there the next day after you left, and [I asked her], 'How does it look? Is it okay?' And she's like, 'It looks great.'”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ellen DeGeneres (@theellenshow)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>“I said, 'Show me around,' and it was like, all of a sudden, 'Wait a minute. Ellen's toothbrush is on my side.' I was like, 'Well, where is my makeup?' So, essentially, you're a terrible roommate. You took over my side and your side," Courteney joked.</p><p>Ellen agreed that she may not be the easiest to live with but blamed the household toothbrush debacle on her wife, whom she said visited her at Courteney’s house one night. Ellen replied, "I only have one side and she happened to be there one night."</p><p>Along with Courteney Cox, Ellen is also close with another former Friends cast member. In the past, Ellen referred to <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> as one of her closest friends, and they even shared a kiss on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ellen DeGeneres Show airs Monday through Friday at 4 p.m. EST on NBC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZJ6knJq7brjIr6Cnn12strW0jJymrqqkmrumxYycprE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
