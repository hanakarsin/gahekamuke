The extract from the report reads:</p><p><i>"His strange behaviour and frequent movement up and down as he eagerly awaits his Asky flight had prompted the security camera operator to focus on him. In the video, Patrick could be seen avoiding physical contacts with airport employees and other passengers during the check in process."</i></p><p><strong>Related:&nbsp;FG Requests Ebola Drug From US</strong></p><p>Sawyer arrived Lagos on July 23 for an ECOWAS convention in Calabar. He reportedly fell ill while on board and was rushed to the hospital where he died from Ebola symptoms on July 25.</p><p>However, based on the video footage the man was lying flat on his stomach on the floor in the corridor of the airport and seemed to be in pain.</p><p>Another Liberian newspaper, FrontPage Africa, said that Sawyer had vomited several times before going to the airport, which was witnessed by his friends. The newspaper correspondent Rodney Sieh confirmed to Premium Times:</p><p><i>"He definitely knew he was sick and it was curious that he still decided to travel.&nbsp;His sister had died from the virus and he most likely had contact with her."</i></p><p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;the death toll from this year's EVD outbreak approaches 1000, according to World Health Organization&nbsp;(WHO).</p><p>In Nigeria, apart from Patrick Sawyer, one more person died from the disease: the nurse who attended the Liberian man. It was made known yesterday by the Nigeria's health minister that 5 more cases of infection with the virus had been registered in the country.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhHGEl2tloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
