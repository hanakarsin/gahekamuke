Trans people and allies left the Hollywood office abruptly at 10:30 am PST.</p><p>Dave Chappelle's Netflix special, <a href=#>The Closer</a>, began streaming on Oct. 5. In a sweeping transphobic routine, the award-winning comedian proudly described himself as "Team TERF," stating that "gender is a fact" and ridiculing the rights and identities of trans people.</p><p>Dave has received heavy criticism for his hate speech, and the troubling culture in the Netflix offices has since come to light.</p><p>The subsequent walkout was organized by Team Trans* at Netflix. The protest culminated in a rally held to "underscore the importance of responsible content offerings that prioritize the safety and dignity of all marginalized communities," organizers declared as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why are Netflix employees walking out?

"That's absurd, and just further shows that Black trans people are the ones being targeted in this conversation.</p><p>Another trans employee, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terra Field</a>, was also temporarily suspended after posting a viral thread criticizing Netflix for streaming the special.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Wikimedia Commons</span></figure><p>In the days leading up to the walkout, employees compiled a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">list of demands</a> in a letter, which also encourages Netflix to do better in creating a safer, more accepting environment for trans people. These demands include investing in more trans creators and talent, vetting content that could be deemed harmful and hateful, and hiring more trans folks and BIPOC as content executives.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Trans inclusivity efforts have celebrity backing.</h2><p>The efforts to create an accepting work environment at Netflix have been met with celebrity support.
