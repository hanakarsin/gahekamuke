Mikel Obi has failed to establish himself under Jose Mourinho despite appearing in over 200 games for the English Champions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkyt23r5uj71qbig.jpeg><p>A move to Al Ain and Fenerbache almost materialized earlier in the summer but the midfielder refused to move. One stumbling block is the fact that the Nigerian's fiancée lives in London where he recently purchased a house for both of them to live.</p><p><i><strong>Alex Song:</strong></i> When Barcelona paid close to $20m for Song in 2012 eyebrows were raised over the abilities or qualities the Cameroonian would bring to the team. Song cannot find a way into a midfield that contains Iniesta, Rakitic, Busquets, Mascherano, Sergi Samper, Sergio Roberto, Rafinha and the recently purchased Arda Turan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt2bnkra3ug72.jpeg><p>Song almost secured a permanent switch to West Ham where he spent last season on loan but the move failed to materialize. Captain Kevin Nolan has left the Hammers and that could be the route for Song to still secure a switch. Arsenal need a physical presence in midfield but a move to the Gunners looks unlikely with the club already over stocked with midfielders.</p><p><i><strong>Victor Moses:</strong> </i>Moses seemed set to feature in the Chelsea team regularly this season but the recent injury suffered by the winger and the signing of Pedro from Barcelona has pushed Moses further down the pecking order. A move to West Ham and Aston Villa as been speculated in the English press and it would be good for Moses to leave Chelsea to gain regular playing time. Meanwhile, Chelsea have Hazard, Pedro, Oscar, Willian on the wings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt4888mfndebu.jpeg><p><strong><i>Emmanuel Mayuka</i>: </strong>Mayuka seems to be a forgotten man on the south coast. The Zambian lit up Africa in January of 2012 when his inspired performances pushed his country to the 2012 AFCON title on home soil. Mayuka has years ahead of him (he is 24 years old) and could do with a move away from Southampton to a club in need of striking reinforcements.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt736krfb4uq2.jpeg><p><strong><i>Kwadwo Asamoah</i>: </strong>That knee injury suffered at Empoli in November 2014 ruled Asamoah out for most of the season and when he returned Paul Pogba had made his central midfield position his own. The recent addition of Alex Sandro will diminish the Ghanian's chances of playing. But the departure of Vidal and Pirlo coupled with the injury suffered by Khedira means that a spot in midfield is open. He could slot alongside Pogba and Marchisio in a three man midfield.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt6p8fn0f2j7r.jpeg><p><strong><i>Brown Ideye/Victor Anichebe</i>: </strong>A year ago, Ideye Brown arrived at West Bromwich Albion as the side’s record signing but one year later his time at the club seems to be up. Over the summer the club signed two strikers, Rickie Lambert and Salomon Rondon, which means the Baggies have several first team strikers contending for two spots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt4r8nna72nt9.jpeg><p>The most expendable seems to be another Nigerian Victor Anichebe who has been linked with Burnley in the championship. Anichebe has failed to fulfill a potential that promised so much. The two Nigerians could be sold along with Saido Berahino before August 3o.</p><p><strong><i>Tokelo Rantie</i>:</strong> Nigerians will remember Rantie as the man who ended Nigeria's chances of attending the 2015 AFCON. In the qualifiers Rantie scored three goals in three matches against Nigeria from the wings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt1j4jmov6rj0o.jpeg><p>According to goal.com, he made 12 appearances in the Championship, in the Bournemouth's title-winning campaign, but didn’t once make Eddie Howe’s starting lineup. His displays for South Africa show the man has talent and needs to move in order to save his international career.</p><p><strong><i>Jonathan Mensah</i>:</strong> Jonathan Mensah's talent cannot be doubted but his four-month ban for an illegal transfer means he cannot attract top clubs like Celtic who pulled out of a deal to take him from the French Ligue 2 club Evian.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt76qk8hq0o4i.jpeg><p><strong><i>Kevin Prince Boateng</i>:</strong> KPB was on top of the world in 2010 after he almost inspired Ghana to the semi-final of the World Cup but after a successful three-year spell with AC Milan of Italy, Boateng joined Schalke in 2013.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkytj6ev3m77m8g.jpeg><p>A combination of bad behaviour and wrong choices made sure the midfielder is marginalized at his club. A move to Al Ittihad fell through and it seems no top-level club is ready to sign the Germany-born player.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgnR9lm1sZqWZoLKtedKopaBlkZu%2Fqq%2FAp2SppJGusrO%2FjKecnpxdmLWiusaeZJykpZfAb7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
