Addressing the Joker star's recent Golden Globe win, the longtime talk show host proceeded to discuss his looks.&nbsp;</p><p>Going through his facial features, she then began to talk about his upper lip, which has a small scar on it that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joaquin was born with</a> and never had surgically repaired.&nbsp;</p><p>To really finalize her point about Joaquin's "cleft lip," she<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> pulls up her own mout</a>h (in a fish hook motion) with her finger, stating, "I find it to be very attractive." Following the 55-year-old's comments on her talk show, individuals took to social media to voice their outrage.

"You are such an ignorant person, no idea why you have a show - making fun of an actor because if his cleft lip is honestly disgusting," tweeted one individual.&nbsp;</p><p>Another added, "I don't know why anti bullying has been a huge thing in this country for years, but Hollywood still lets @WendyWilliams have a show. ... My nephew who has a cleft lip and the kids suffering shouldn't be the butt of your jokes."</p><p>Canadian football player Adam Bighill also spoke out via Twitter against Wendy, writing, "Are you kidding me??? We all have a responsibility to #EndBullying. With her platform, like myself, we have a much higher responsibility when it comes to our actions. This is just terrible."</p><p>Adam also tweeted that both he and his son Beau (who is currently undergoing corrective surgery) were born with a "bilateral cleft lip and palate."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Today is Beau’s big day. He is getting his lip repaired today in Winnipeg by the fantastic Dr. Ross. Thanks to everyone who has reached out, and in advance, thanks for any of your well wishes for Beau.

"We’re thinking about Beau today as he is in surgery. I want to apologize to the cleft community and in Beau’s honor, our show is donating to @operationsmile and @AmerCleftPalate and encourage our Wendy Watchers to learn more and help support the cleft community," she tweeted on Jan. 15.&nbsp;</p><p>We're happy Wendy finally issued an apology and is donating money to a great cause.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLKvsNhmrqKknJ6urr%2BMqZytoaSevK8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
